Awesome Movie!
dicaprio must win this oscar , he deserves it
Awsome muvi they deserve it
now its DESERVES best picture and actor SUNDAY NIGHT AT THE OSCARS!!!!!!!
The best Dicapro movie e er!!! üëçüòÉ
Sweep of Oscars next
Well deserved however the Academy rarely splits their vote in the Sound categories when a hugely successful, action-driven film is nominated for both awards (Gravity, Inception, The Hurt Locker, King Kong, The Bourne Ultimatum, The Matrix, Saving Private Ryan.....). That's why Mad Max is on track to win BOTH sound mixing and sound editing.
i love this movie!
Congrats and deserving
Best movie üé•!!!! üëå
Well deserved. Awesome movie.
Bear for Oscar!!!!!
And Best Actor: Leonardo DiCaprio
Best movie <3
WELL, THEY DON¬¥T SHINE FOR THE LACK OF AWARDS!;OD
This was amazing!
Best movie/actor. LOVE.
I now present  The Revenant triple crown winner,(Best Picture, Best Director & Best Actor)!!!!!! SIGNED, SEALED & DELIVERED
Vraiement super comme film g ador√© du d√©but √†  la fin
Awesome movie!
As much as I enjoyed this film, there were some serious flaws in editing. Most filming was in Canada but we understand they had to  go to the mountains in Argentina to finish the winter scenes. So one minute they're in the flat lands of North Dakota and the next minute they're on a mountaintop in the Andes. One minute it's a summer scene on a river - and the next minute they're on a snowy mountaintop again. It made no sense. The director should have caught these careless mistakes.
Love my Leo
J'ai h√¢te de voir ce film
beautiful movie, absolutely speechless
great movie
i really want to see this
congraaaatssssssssssss!!!!!!!........and good luck with the Oscar!
Don't think it deserves all the credit that it's getting  If being the only person in the film with any real role and actually being able to carry the whole movie deserves an Oscar then so be it But there are a lot of other films nominated that are more deserving Well that is my opinion ;)
Awesome movie!!!
I just love this movie I hope they win all their Oscar  nominations
Awesome movie!!!
One of the best movies of the decade. If not the best movie of the decade. Most gorgeous cinematography ever in a major film. Let's sweep the Oscars! Dillon Thomas Dick Kayli Elisabeth Beard
The Revenant Movie with Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing and deserve all kinds of awards nominations. This is a true OSCAR movie. Powerful! Congratulations wonderful cast!
here come the oscars
One of best movies in last 10 years.. :D
great movie !
Well deserved however sun glare and water droplets on a camera lens don't do much for a film's opening sequence.  I'm going to watch this film a second time to see if I've missed something.
Hopefully lots of Oscars this weekend #Leo
My husband and I just watched the movie.super worth to watch..u can't believe how they film the movie..
They deserve all the awards.congrats all of you
i finally went to see the film today.....no words....I hope Leo wins....
Saw the movie last night. Awesome movie.

Brilliant acting Leonardo, and hats off to the Director 
Leonardo DiCaprio  surely deserves the Oscar for this incredible movie!!
Leo For the Oscars <3
Well it was an awesome movie with great acting of Leonardo and Tom so it deserve a grammy

Un filme bien logrado, es correcto, pero Spotlight Movie es mejor.
Great movie!!!
Don't even need an Oscar! Great movie! Great picture! Outstanding actings!
Now for the Oscar...
Kudos to Michael Punke for writing this fantastic book! And he is my nephew!!!
You deserve it.
And the scenery! Was supposed to depict 1820's Great Plains USA but was filmed in Canada.. So beautiful
Great movie
Wicked movie loved it
It's a really good movie
Congratulations, Praise be to God.
The Revenant Movie will establish itself within the cinema classics for all time , and most deserving in Oscar's categories of best film , best actor Leonardo DiCaprio, and best director Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu, it's the collaboration of extraordinarily talented individuals that pieced together a masterpiece in filmmaking.  And if they can sing why not a Grammy too !  :)
Awesome, let's go 4 the oscars!!
The British Academy has good taste.
Incredible masterpiece of cinema
Gaby Hernandez so proud! üò¢
Extraordinary movie!
Feel good comedy of the year! Bring the whole family!
The Best performance of Dicaprio, he deserves The Oscar absolutelly
IT SO HAS TO BE LEO'S YEAR....the Oscar better go to him
Leo's time is coming......
BEST SHOW ever,üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ
you deserve more than that.
Best film I've seen in years. What a storyline, and what a cast. DiCaprio and Hardy were phenomenal.
Awesome But we're waiting for Oscar 
The revenant killer movie
Leo's won everything so far. If he doesn't win the Oscar for best actor. I may riot a little. üòâ
Ahlam Bennadir just to have an idea abt how great is this movie !
And the osacr to the best movie ever made is for...The revenant üòú
Glad that I was part of this epic movie
DiCaprio for the win! I am only watching the Oscars to see him take home his first.
Great Movie
I loved everything about the movie.. except that it drug on for too damn long.
I hope DiCaprio wins!  ! !!
This is one  I'll have to own,  watch again...
Loved the powerful character development without needless dialogue! What a masterpiece!
I love this movie!!
If you haven't had the chance to watch the revenant yet you can watch it here (bit. ly/therevenantx)
Amazing film, amazing actors and acting, Leo is a Great Actor! 
Love him, can't wait for him get an Oscar üòäüëçüèª
awesome movie incredible acting
Fantastic!! Great movie!! Cinematography was incredible.
Awesome movie!!
I think it should at least get an Oscar for Best Cinematography. Some of those shots were just breathtaking.
Love this movie . Very intense .
Cannot wait for Leo to finally win the Oscar that he has deserved for years of incredible work. The Revenant is one of the best films I've ever seen.
The best movie I have ever seen
Richard Delgado, but will he get an oscar/grammy?? üò†üò†üò†
Saw it, loved it!  DiCaprio nailed it again.  So into character one forgets it's him.
Yay!! My new favorite movie.
It was a well made movie. But I give it an F for the historical accuracy category. That sure as hell was not how that part of Hugh Glass's life went.
Best movie everüòòüòòüòò
Loved this movie - great story
Great movie. You performed the role excellent. Well deserved accomplishment.
Did that f$#kin bear win anything!!
I saw the movie in Brazil, the best 2016. The history is impressive and the actor is dedicated on the movie.
I agree with Jay Flugum,  the best film
Got to watch it Saturday!   Awesome movie!
GIVE THAT MAN AN OSCAR
fantastic movie so loved it
Incredible raw dark beautifully filmed with outstanding music.  Seen it twice would see it again if I lived closer.  Artfully done with passion by true artists!  DiCaprio acting was incredible...not about talking!  You have to feel this kind of movie!

Felicidades! a la mejor pelicula The Revenant Movie.
Well deserved. Brilliant film.
This film was one of the most emotional movies i have ever watched.  What wonderful acting and story telling.  It is a must see movie.
Brilliant film. Loved it!
It's deserved to win
Congratulations to "the revenant team" !!! This movie deserves to win Oscar as well... Best wishesüëçüëç

Zeker verdiend ! Super film en acteerprestatie.
Had to go see it twice already!
How does a remake earn best film???
Hay verla Eduardo De Hoyos !!!
We will se the movie on Friday :)
What a wonderful movie and Leo and Tom  killed it!!!!
Congratulations The Revenant Movie you were FANTASTIC! And with Leonardo DiCaprio, everything is sucess, and he was there making the difference.
:* love u diCaprio :'( Oscar deserve u ;)
Great film and actor but lets not leave out those behind the film and I'm talking about Dr. James Hanson from the Museum of the Fur Trade. With his dedicated skills in history he helped Dicaprio reach a pinnacle point in movie history,.. There should be an award for such a great historian!!
Awesome movie
I am shooting in a The Revenant spoof tomorrow!  Can't wait!
If Leo does not get an Oscar.....I don't know what he has to do next? Good luck Leo! It's your year!!!
Next up The Oscars, The Revenant will sweep the Awards, (Triple Crown) Best Actor, Best Director, & Best Picture (This race) It's over, finished
(y)the next is the OSCAR !!!
Awesome movie. Where casting Lionardo di caprio & Bri larson.
You guys deserve it
Big upp and one oscar for you Leo!
Amazing and love Leonardo DiCaprio
‚ù§Ô∏è this movie
PORQUE CHUCHA HABLAN INGLES SI ESTAMOS EN CHILITO LINDO..JAA
You deserve a Oscar guys.
I need to see it again bought tickets
Gritty yet beautiful, violent yet touching. Brilliant work of art!
Enjoyed it verry mutch
Leo was better in The Wolf of Wall Street but he should have gotten this oscar even earlier. The Revenant Movie is still beautiful to look at though.
Such a beautiful film!
It's on my personal list as the best movie in a decade  - Leo and the whole crew that worked on this movie will be raking in the Oscars. Very happy to see him as a fine actor and a generous conservationist winning the award for Best Actor!
Don't be afraid of seeing this movie.  It's not gory, nor does it show excess violence....believe me I avoid those movies, but thought this was terrific.  Nothing but admiration for those involved in getting it to the silver screen!
I have seen it twice and will probably see it again in theatres...unbelieveable tale of love and strength!
The Best Movie I've ever ever seen..... Been to the theater several times to see this and It will be hard to watch other new movies because nothing will ever come close to this one.... You are on a journey of breathless emotion.... the entire movie!  What an experience.
Game Leo shakes! movie inspires the best.
Saw this yesterday! There is so much to love about this film! Great acting ,touching tale of family love,gorgeous scenery,the will to survive against the odds! I want to see it again,it was that good!!!
THIS BETTER WIN!!!
amazing movie .. love it
well my last of the mohicans blu-ray isnt working so i cant wait for this
Wanna c it sometime this week
Esa mezcla de belleza y dolor ,es increible , el dolor fisico y emocional es algo que todos sentimos alguna vez , o quizas a diario, exelente pelicula.
Exceptional filmmaking , the underlying  subtext of the movie is survival in the face of adversity, beautifully and artistically woven together in the vastness of natural locations so expertly conveyed to the audience , every element of this film and the skill of telling a story was absolutely brilliant, Leonardo DiCaprio has embedded himself as exemplary in terms of devotion to his craft and iconic within the film industry, The Revenant Movie contributes as such, director Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu generously delivers a cinematic gift to the audience,    everyone involved in the production of it's filming is deserving of the artistic and creative recognition , a line up of Oscar's .
C'ant wait to see it with my honey
Excellent movie!!! Would highly recommend!!
Stephen Jones
The reverent is the best movie in decades.. Fantastic filmmaking that I've ever seen in my life time.. excellent directors, producers and  actors that played in this true event that happen in 1820's .. :)
Zali boze 400dinara sto sam dao.
Tonight? Eric
I loved it and I hope it wins. I've seen it three times! The second and third times I was able to notice the symbolism of the film and enjoy the scenery more. I am not tired of it yet! 
An exceptional job was done in all areas on this film!
For a fine, talented and accomplished actor as Mr Leonardo DiCaprio, there's no doubt that The Oscars were his rightfully way back. His performance in The Revenant was Epic!!! If Leo doesn't get an Oscar for The Revenant, than the Academy Awards is just an eye-wash.
Amazing film.......
Phenomenal performance by Mr Di Caprio, as usual. It was one the best performances I have seen. He definitely deserves an Oscar.
'Seeing again; can't wait!
Awesome movie
it was an amazing experience!
And the Oscar  go,s to   no ?
Want to see this Saturday with Tom
La vi me gusto mucho y la actuaci√≥n de Leonardo  Dicaprio es genial bueno como siempre que se gane todos las estatuillas....üëè
Excellent movie!  DiCaprio never ceases to amaze.
Amazing film- especially the bear scene. Bear Grylls on steroids!
Alexia Spina bora ?
Just saw this movie today and was blown away with emotion on so many levels. First and foremost, how does Leo achieve such a deep and all encompassing level of character? Where does he go to get to that depth? It was mind boggling! What an exceptional performance so well deserved of an Oscar nomination and win. The cinematography was gorgeous, the music...it was intense to say the least, difficult to watch often times...the dream sequence..it was all phenomenal work. Bravo!!
LA VI HOY. DEMASIADO BUENA. TODO ES BUENO. GUION, INTERPRETACI√ìN, TOMAS, LUZ, ESCENOGRAFIA, PAISAJES TODOOO!
Love the movie esp. Leonardo and tom hardy
After seeing The Revenant for the second time, i have to say that it is the most breathtaking film i have witnessed in recent years.
brutal winter stuff
in my opinion this is LEO s most hardest role so far in his acting career and for sure to win the most elusive gold trophy from the ACADEMY. LEO is too good in this movie, im so impressed and became more n love with him as idol.
incredible movie Really worth the money
Lo m√°ximo la pelicula muy recomendable vayan a verla es muy emocionante se merece un Oscar!!!
saw the movie yesterday 5 ***** very honest and graphic...great movie, would recommend to everyone
Best movie ever!!
Saw the last night. Incredible. Such power behind every scene. Love you Leonardo di  Caprio. And Tom Hardy you were also outstanding. üòä
Definitely best of the best in 2015.
this film is bad
This is the best movie I've ever seen. Nr.1 in my top ten
Strong movie till now i watched
A visceral and immersive experience on the human survival, the most unsettling movie for a decade!
Theck you leo ils a big movie
D√©cor somptueux pour un superbe film! Leo au top comme d'habitude, sinon plus... Que demander d'autre??? Un Oscar, il le m√©rite!
OUTSTANDING movie...
epic joke when is the next best movie of the year comming out next week
keep his ass out of alberta if he thinks its so bad hypocryte
Deze film Rika Piet van Brakel
Jaw Dropping Performance Again.Leonardo DiCaprio you Rock!! Hollywood to me is you!
Great picture i have ever seen, Leo is more than perfect of his role.
Valentin Retel il a l'air super !!!!
Go to the Oscar for a great and talented actor  Leonardo DiCaprio and the will to survive against the odds....and a exceptional filmmaking.....i hope he wins the Oscar for the best actor....i hope :)
saw this this afternoon, what a wonderful movie...definite an Oscar winner for best picture and actor.
Just another American "bullshoot" movie, highly disappointed...
Really wish they would have stuck more closely to the book version. Still a good movie though.
OMG!!! What a great movie. Leonardo will win the Oscar! Fantastic Epic movie! Must see!
blown away after watching that movie. exceptional direction by alejandro. and how Leo indulged in this character was mind blowing. best movie of this century. and ofcourse Hardy is love.
Poor bear... Unnecesary and silly animal hunting :/
Jorrit Ritzen heb je hem al gezien?
I love this film, became my favorite movie .. It's very good, and the actor? The Pfffff the best actor in the world, Leonardo, I love you!!!üòª
This film should take the Oscar
Oh Leo!!! <3  You got it this time <3 Your Year <3 Finally :)
I  watched the movie today and wow this movie is one of the best that i have seen
Superb performane by Leonardo....an excellent movie in all aspects and now Oscar should go to this movie !
√ìtimo filme! Vale a pena assistir! A atua√ß√£o de Leo DiCaprio merece palmas, els se superou, inclusive fisicamente! E as imagens, o lugar onde o filme foi gravado, os personagens.... impec√°veis! üëèüëèüëè
Everything about this movie is incredible üòÄ Such awesome cast
Vamos Leo DiCaprio a caminho da vit√≥ria! "The Revernant" √© uma obra de Arte de talento! Lio √© o melhor Ator do mundo! Glorioso!!
Enerverend werkje, take in enough energie before start of this trip.
All of dicaprio characters way back to what's eating Gilbert grape should've been all oscar WINNERS((is there anyone else that could've played his part in grape that good??))...I can't remember anyone else he was up against over the years for the oscar that even compared to him on his level.we all know why he never took home an oscar.I stopped watching the academy after he was snubbed so many times,this year may change that though...
The cinemaphotography was from another planet. THUMBS UP for this guy.
He is a genius.
Leo is the soul of this movie. Tom was great too. They made director look good in this movie.
This movie is out of this world
I knew it s Oscar movie üé•
Oh, Yes, Congrats, I wish you all the best, I'm so proud to be you're cousin. Have a nice Sunday ;).
Saw the movie last night. Awesome movie. Great acting and directing and camera work. If Leo doesn't finally get an oscar for this performance then the system is truly broken. Leo's performance was top knotch.  Every  painful event of his character I could feel the pain, especially with the bear scene. Bravo
Well deserved!
History will honor #The_Revenant_Movie
Tom deserve an award for supporting actor as well
Alright!! Hopefully it'll win Best Picture
He literally deserves another Oscar
El mero mero!
It's been a long time that I've been so enthralled in a movie and this one was awesome! Thank you Alejandro Inarritu and actors for an amazing movie!
So Very Deserved!!! EPIC Movie!! Took My Breath Away Many Times!!
Completely deserved. I wonder what he and Leo will say when they win their Oscars?
One of the greatest directors of our time if you only know him from birdman or the revenant. I really encourage you to check out some of his older films there all very good it all started with Amores perros
This man earned it. Such an incredible achievement in film making.
This is one movie I'll never forget ! I even had a nightmare my dog turned into a grizzly and my horse ripped open his stomach by jumping over a barbed wire fence and I had to crawl inside ! Well done !
i need some-one who can stay awake take me gold class, purly for my spinal comfort so i can actually go
This is the award The Revenant needed to once again, push it ahead of the other films in the Best Picture race. The last DGA winner to lose the Best Director Oscar was Rob Marshall in 2003. I don't think Inarritu is going to lose the Oscar.
Great movie üëèüëèüëè great job of all üéâüéâ
Mexico's Diamond in the meadow!! Hats off to you sir.
Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor in a Leading Role should be on lock for this one at the Oscars...
Is this the same guy who did "Gravity"?
Such a good movie, better than Dances with Wolves yea I said it!
One of the best I've seen. Believable, realistic and mesmerizing to the end. 10/10
This is such an amazing movie, anyone that tells me should I go see this movie, I tell them to get their butts to the movies already and they do not come out disappointed at all, I just LOVE this movie so much!
It's either going to be him or George Miller that's going to win the Oscar
It's the most amazing movie I've ever seen....thank you always for the amazing spiritual journey... Saw it many times and will again until it's no longer at theater....preordered copy too!
Congratulations to you!
I grew up listening to stories about Hugh, nice to see it brought to the screen.
Well deserved. Loved the film can't wait for bluray.
He's the best director, thanks for this beautiful movie Alejandro :)
Congratulations Leonardo and Alejandro for outstanding Directorial and Performance that put me in tears last night when I saw the movie! I felt all the pain.. it's about endurance, the purpose of surviving and love.. the movie puts things in perspective that I never felt it before. The camera was so well targeting Leo, an absolute gift to the audience! It was a moment in the Theater when   everybody was not even breathing, a propound silence..respect for this piece of art!!!   I cannot wait for the Oscar.. should be without a doubt Alejandro and Leo's  night! Thank you for a wonderful night that will stay with me for a long time!
Honestly, what this man has given us on screen with The Revenant is just jaw-dropping and left me in awe. Stunning film - both visually and emotionally.
Was great
The instinctive skill and devotion to every detail of this masterpiece in filmmaking is so carefully guided by it's director Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu , a real testament of visionary scope and ability to richly depict the terrain and landscape of the wilderness, the cinematography is interwoven with every artistic aspect of the film , beautifully captured and a collaborative exception of every element coming together , Leonardo DiCaprio has established himself as Oscar caliber .
What a great man! And what a great joy to see him being appreciated by his fellow directors!
many congrats! :D
You are a pride for all of us, that we are Mexicans. üíØ
Sheer brilliance I've seen the movie 3 times now...enjoy every aspect of it...the cinematography acting directing...the whole cast and crew were amazing...you deserve every accolade for this amazing film..üé•..cheers Dc M Bourdainüòé
It really was the best movie this year! If Leo doesn't win best actor at the oscars, I will never participate with them again.
I seen this movie twice. Cant wait to it comes on Blue Ray
El Terrifico Alejandro!!!!, Went to see the film last month Hope you win The Oscar for Best Director & Best Picture GRACIAS!!!!
I want my money back...
It's a long time to astonish or enthralled in a movie back to years but look zis magnificent Leo hw he acted definitely if he can not win z Oscar ....things r too damn for z industry.
As much as I liked the film, George Miller deserved it for Fury Road.
So proud of him !
I want those glasses!
Amazing movie ! A must to see
And to P Scott Sakamoto who won the SOC award for Camera Operator of the Year for The Revenant!
Alejandro G. I√±√°rritu, congratulations for your awesome hard work movie. You showed how much you are very talented, and working with Leonardo DiCaprio, you just make your bigest difference. Powerful!
This guy is in the top one for me
Thank you for blessing us with this amazing film.  We are so grateful.
Amazing cinematography! I've read somewhere that they used natural lighting and environment so yeah just amazing! But that's just part of it! I noticed that for the most part, the cameraman used single sequence shots for most of the scenes. That's hardwork for everyone in the cast and crew! The Oscars is theirs! I will consider DiCaprio as robbed if he doesn't get the Best Actor Award.
P. S. We watched the movie in the cinema house which boasts Dolby Atmos. It was an awesome 3D sound experience! üëçüèª
A most wonderful experience at the movies. Acting, directing, camera work, a cinematographic work of art. A wonderful cast as well. Oscar winning  performances
Best movie i saw in a long time !
Absolutely deserved
Alejandro, las mil y un felicitaciones son merecidas  para tanto  talento,  tu equipo, tus actores y el gran esfuerzo dan como resultado esta obra majestuosa. 
,
A huevo Nef Zald√≠var
Fantastic movie
Tu ya eres Innegablemente Un GENIO de la Cinematograf√≠a Universal ALEJANDRO.  A la misma Altura de un JEAN LUC GODARD, de un FEDERICO FELLINI, de un AKIRA KUROSAWA , de un INGMAR BERGMAN o de un WERNER  HERZOG.  !!! FELICIDADES !!! Y !!!! VIVA MEXICO !!!!!!!
Leo, you're next!
well deserved ! :)))
He deserved the award as does everyone involved. It was amazing.
If Leonardo doesn't win an Oscar this time!!!!
Whoohooo!!!!  And Birdman last year, too! Love his work
i was soooo captivated.  cant wait for the blu-ray
In one full swoop, Inarritu deconstructs and transforms an entire genre. Which was the case with his last film, and the film before...
Thank you for your following your dreams and making the most extraordinary movie I have ever seen....
Congratulation Sr. this movie is the your best work until now. 1¬™ The Revenant  2¬∫ Babel  3¬∫ Amores perros
Phenomenal movie!
Was it good as may be able to see it up here!!!
Well deserved. It's one of the most well made and beautiful films to date. Hope it does great at The Oscars.
Credit should also be given to cinematographer "chivo" Emmanuel Lubezki whose stunning visuals and camera work got us so close to the action I felt I was there.
Saw the movie last night. One of the most boring, predictable, in some parts even ridiculous movie ever made!
Congratulations Best Director Alejandro Gonz√°les I√±√°rritu!  You are truly The Best! ‚ù§Ô∏èüòäüëåüèº
Llor√© con una emoci√≥n indescriptible con el final. Es algo tan brillante que no se puede explicar.
In today's movie scene where a lot of films are made in the green screen this man took it to the next level thank u Alejandro g inarritu and viva Mexico cabron
BUT - did they hurt or kill a buffalo and the horse?????  I cannot find this on the list of movies approved by humane society
Wow! First time in the history to win a back-to-back awards! Congrats!!!!
Fatine Jemil i love himüòçüòç who makes this movie !!üôåüôå
Well deserved !
The best movie! Leonardo is a exelent actor!
Just saw this movie, i never go to see movies anymore since they are hardly any truly good ones, but this is my favorite of all time, it hits the core to everything! Best scenes ( bear) that i have ever seen on screen played out, and Leonardo has done his role of a lifetime with this intense and heartbreaking film, so happy this was made! Bravo!
Awesome freakin movie!!
It's long from Denmark
I Wish I could be there üòî(live in turkey)
the best movie
La venganza no esta en mis manos esta en las manos de "Dios".- Glass
Excellent scoring
Any LA signings?
I wish I could be there
Don't confuse this movie with the 2009 comedy also called The Revenant. When I looked in the Best Buy computer last month I found no soundtrack for Inarritu's 2015-2016 The Revenant but only a soundtrack for the 2009 movie. Don't order the wrong soundtrack. I sent email to WDNA-FM praising the use of percussion in Inarritu's The Revenant. Was Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu a soundtrack man before he became a movie director?
Arya Hawker I imagine you'll be all over this.
This concert will reveal many hidden feelings and I'm sure gonna be fun :-)
The bear scene was fantastic, and the acting top notch, but the movie was 40 minutes too long marked by melodramatic music.
Wow I saw it Leonardo and hardy both amazing
On sunday i shall se it, am glad  it last for 3 hour ‚ò∫
I wait to i go cinema, i have watch
Congrats for this movie! Really you are a GRAET ARTIST!  WHAT IT MEANS (Y)  !!!!!!!!!!
The Revenant Online ---> www.hellovideo.pl
I must admit i look forward, i love this film
Oscar goes to Leonardo Dicaprio .
Great soundtrack and film! Whats up with all these ads n spam in comments?
What a movie... I'm still speechless.. Leonardo DiCaprio deserves an Oscar for this incredible performance (y)
BEST MOVIE EVER !!!!!!!
Speechless ........ AMAZING MOVIE!
Unbelievable cinematography and acting, phenomenal script.
The performance of Leo Di Caprio is solid like a rock!. In other ways the heightened sensibility of I√±√°rritu makes of this film an  visualization poetry  of the all the emotions of the humans.

This movie is savage, is a film where the reality makes love with the fantasy.

Intense, full of guts, if not win the Oscar does not matter, because is a visual epiphany,  where we can understand why the Cinema is called the seventh Art.
the photography was beautiful, the soundtrack is less than mediocre....
Great movie ... you are the best Leonardo DiCaprio ... I think you are a smart actor since Gilbert Grape ...

its really get oscar n i know it great job Leonardo
So proud! !! Amazing movie! !! Now bring home that Oscar! !!
Leonardo di Caprio <3 
I saw this movie and this is fabulous 
#leonardodicaprio <3
It's weird he'd get for it for this particular role, considering he says maybe ten lines (exaggeration??).. It's more about how he reacts, and interacts with the other characters in this film.. These awards are about hype really.. He should have three already (just my opinion). I think Scorsese would agree with me.
Even if he get an oscar. Its not enogh
A masterpiece!
And he has definitely deserved it, saw the movie yesterday and there was an amazing silence during the movie and sometimes you could hear a pin drop. Beautiful and impressive movie and performances.  I salute all of you.
Awesome Movie!
nos falta un poqitin mi Leito no scuchs esos sufridores q habln mal d ti lo hacn xq eres un grn actor no soportan tus grands logros pro aqi stoy y stare para apoyart siempre My Love
Bring home that Oscar! It's your year Leo!
Beautiful, amazing, and an intense film. Leo is wonderful in this and deserves his Oscar for his performance!
Who else...this film production actor and director is the best film of the year..leo and tom hardy superb as were all of the cast and crew...superb film..

Just watched catch me if you can again on tv last night. Good I love that man!
Laura Serrano
I think Academy will not give Leo most important award again this time. :(
making movies as same as going to high school... u just have to earn your own grades ... and Revenant has proved that they have earned their grade... AAAAAA....  superior works for the Revenant ...
I ain't afride to die anymore because I done it already.
Next stop the Oscars! Leo did a fabulous job for his performance for such a brutally powerful and a beautiful movie!
Mustafa its happening
Finally , Happiness is what when #Leonardo grab the award infact ! :)
CONGRATULATION  TO ACTOR  Leonardo DiCaprio
I wanna see this!!!!
Congrats Leo! Shame Tom didn't get a nomination, but Leo is always gracious and mentions his co-stars so there's that at least.
Best movie i have seen in years....Mr Dicaprio is excellent in this movie you forget it is him on the screen
Amazing movie!!üíØüíØCongrats Leonardo DiCaprioüòòüòò!! U deserves the Oscar!!!!!!
You deserve it.Congratulations!!!!  :) ;) ^_^
Great movie! Leo, you are the best!
I so hope Leonardo DiCaprio wins finally and Academy Award, not only for his faultless and impressive performance on the film but for his effort over the years, for his evolution as an actor and the most important, as a person.
Wanna see it?????
Leo's running the table
What a great movie! Well worth all accolades received. Leonardo deserves the Oscar no question.
Superb acting by mr.dicaprio! It's stunning,how he makes the audience silent and crying by his outstanding performance! And in the end,is hugh glass dying? I'm not sure how to see this scene...:-(
It was totally the best movie of the year, you couldn't compare this with anything else, Leonardo DiCaprio's performance was amazing, and if he doesn't win the Oscar on this movie, I guess he never will #DiCaprioForOscar
Leo has won over 20 awards for Best Actor for The Revenant! That has to be a lock for the Oscars, I swear if he doesn't win someone in the Academy has it out for him lol.....
Ya denle el Oscar :v si no se lo dan, ya es porque tiene muy mala suerte
Fully deserved on so many levels of artistic evolution and generosity with the highest standards of commitment to each role he portrays ,  he embodies  the attributes of the consummate actor and gives 100%  of himself  , a finely distinguished contribution to the film industry.
Well deserved.  Awesome movie all the way around.
Just saw it brilliant Leo and hardy world class
Everyone talks about DiCaprio . Well I agree he deserved to win award. But when all talks about him , in my opinion Hardy makes all that movie . One sentence describe his role - If you wanna job done right HARDY do it well.
Deservingly so! Great movie
Congrats, well deserved..fantastic movie!
Off to see it today, so excited based on the reactions here!   #goingsolo
One of the best movie so far üëçüèªüëå

Superb ! So many congrats to Lio !
amazing performance. it takes a great act to make me forget who is playing the part. Leonardo pulled this off in spades! believable. I forced myself to look through the character to find the actor just to prove to myself it was him.
Cudos to all the actors, each held their own definitely!
Bravo!

Survival is the undercurrent of this Epic film, this type of cinema is important as a broader message of strength , knowledge gained from adversity, and a testament of the human spirit and will to overcome, Native Americans are richly and vividly depicted as deeply connected to earth , the wilderness and the soul of the narrative , Leonardo DiCaprio is so carefully measured and powerfully convincing in this brutally been through it all story telling, enriched by the enormity of its cinematography.  Oscar worthy .
Saw the movie yesterday and wow fantastic movie. Great job Leonardo DiCaprio!!!!
Great!Great!Great!
Movie is very very very beautiful
Naja Lauridsen det var den her jeg snakkede om üòÑ
Totally big disappointment!
brilliant movie excellent acting by Leonardo Dicaprio and tom Hardy and all the cast every thing was amazing wish best of luck for the 12 Oscar nomination
Loved the movie.  Grit and an unbelievable will to survive.
Really the film is a true story? It's really unique. A little while ago I came out of the cinema and more scenes are before my eyes. Does It somewhere described the true story?
" As long as You are breathing...fight for Life üí™üèªüå±"  a short wisdom fromThe Best movie i've ever seen in 2016, one who presents the real meaning of one's struggle in life & gives a brief d√©finition of the true  meaning of Life  in an inspiring story pr√©senting the most deepest moments from sad, joyful, powerful & difficut moments humans face throughout their  lives, a movie  which sum up the old indian theory of existence," Everything on the earth has a purpose,every disease an herb to cure it, and every person a mission." A great story, tremendous sound track & quotes of wisdom !! A Must Seeüëåüèª
Just saw it on big screen an hour ago. Two and a half hours of perfect cinematography, visual effects, screenplay and performance. Tom Hardy delivered his character with relative ease. Another great performance. It‚Äôs as if he‚Äôs lived in this world his entire life. As for Leo, what can I say? The only possible way that might happen to him on not getting that best actor award is if he's warped by a bear on his way to the podium. If this film doesn't win Leonardo DiCaprio an Oscar, nothing will.
So far I think the best film in 2015 and maybe 2016.
Excellent production, cinematographic, performances, visual effects... so real!!! The bear fight scene, dead horse scene in the storm and when he ate raw food.... !!!! So real!!!!!! Best Actor Award is for Leo!!!!
EU N√ÉO ACREDITO Q VAI CHEGAR EM IMAX
Leo awesome movie. Well done Bravo Zulu!!!!!!
Damn Good Movie!!
Are you guys gonna have screening in Philippines
?
Great acting  and work guys congrats.
Te amo Leo y esta vez tienen que reconocer tu talento, feliz por esta nueva pel√≠cula!!
&Leonardo DiCaprio, this movie is very exciting and strong, because came from a true story. I cried when the bear attacked Hugh Glass, when he laid on the child's chest deat, and when he slept inside the horse to survive the cold weather. My heart almost came out the mouth throughout the film. Hugh was a great warrior. A much pain in search of survival. Splendid! And you Leo, was brilliant performance along with everyone. Congratulations again, over and over Leonardo DiCaprio, Alejandro Gonz√°les I√±√°rritu and everyone else. You deserve all kinds of awards for showing us scenes in a past reality of so much suffering, and you have suffered a little for it as real. We the viwers suffer at that moment watching the film to see so much suffering. This is another beautiful and said true story that comes to film. Awesome! I fell in love with The Revenant Movie. I have watched three times, and I think I'll again.
Excelente pel√≠cula...  Me fascin√≥ üëèüëèüëè
toma tu oscar a mejor fotograf√≠a
I saw it tonight....it was excellent!
Proud of i√±arritu being mexican and work with an excepcional actor as dicaprio
Too much extreme violance & cruelty in this film and hardly any story. Real US bad quality ...
Absolutely fabulous movie, brutal in parts but fabulous all the same. I wonder if anyone associated with the movie can help me out with diagrams and photo's of the riverboat seen early on in the movie after the Indians attacked the encampment?
Loved the movie, it is truly captivating.  Leo did an amazing job as well as Tom Hardy and Alejandro...this is a movie that stays with after you see it...
Great movie. Congratulations to everyone involved in making it.
Oscar. . I have your next movie.   
Let's go over my movie project. .
Facebook me. . When your team is ready. .  Columbus,Ohio. . Go Bucks.
This movie is a masterpiece...congrats to the director and the cast. It worth every penny.
I liked everything, you don't need a $200 million CGI budget to make a great movie, yes star wars sucked.
Awesome movie!
Amazing ! Amazing !  Love this movie üòÑ
Rafa Flores es esta? ,se ve buenisimaaa vamoooo
Yadira Saldivar aqui esta el trailler de el renacido
Deze was het! Niels
And what anesthetized man rouses the sensational movie...
In spirit this movie reminds me of A Man Called Horse and Jeremiah Johnson, both of these older films incredibly raw for their time and this one too, has that raw sensibility, throwing your mind out and slamming it back in, very entertaining and a very good show.
I hope Leo wins an Oscar,  great movie
Jojan Klaas-Jan Mustafa kom zullen we nog een keer gaan? üòÇüòÇüòÇ oke die was niet grappig.
awesome photography!! amazing all!! very very beautiful movie! great job dicaprio, hardy, all! great job!!

#Dicaprio awesomeüòçüëë   Excellent movie from beginning to end!!
mira amor Zulma C. Rocher quiero que veamos esta pelicula
I have seen every top movie ever - for 65 years. This movie wins my number one prize. It is the ULTIMATE in the art of film-making: entertaining, terrifying, mesmerizing, gratifying and simply ... extraordinary. If Leo does not get Oscar gold for his nothing-short-of-brilliant performance, I hope there is a riot in Hollywood.
Could you tell me about the song of the movie ??
This movie was the bomb.
What a phenomenal masterpiece and I am blown away by this film! It is brutal, violently gruesome and VERY powerful! I'm so glad they won 3 Golden Globes and I really hope not only they take home all the awards on Oscars, but for Leonardo Dicaprio to win Best Actor and the whole movie to win Best Picture!
Wences Chak ko poh om nokoodop ie..what a great movie....

Just got home from watching this awesome movie!
What a great performance of Leonardo!!!! I hope he gets an Oscar, he deserve it!!!!
We saw Room last night and it was excellent. The theater under us was playing The Revenant. We could hear the bear scene!

Oscar for You Leo
great and amazing movie

I have never seen Leonardo DiCaprio, looking so handsome, as he did in this movie! Fabulous movie, will see it again!

If in the middle of a vast wilderness there was one body of water 2 by 2 meters, Leonardo DiCaprio would fall in it!!!
i think alejandro g inarritu is the source of magic in that movie, i mean leonardo could be in any movie but the little details and the portrait of the novel is absolutely fabulous. the only greedy bastard that caught my eye is tom hardy in every scene i can see that he was a true bastard
I hear this movie is loosely based on the pre-teen years of Garrett Hall, growing up in the swamps of Echols County
Amazing movie. Great plot, movie looked Beautiful, Leo's acting was spectacular as always.
Christian Velazquez Flores We es la que vi....
Best action award
Excelente n√∫mero.1 Leonardo D caprio
I never seen such a masterpiece, mesmerizing and unique story with true based. now its time for grasp all the Oscar.  And yeah  Leonardo DiCaprio and director Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu  did amazing things. cheer! :)
filme muito bom com a historia intrigante e muita viol√™ncia na medida do poss√≠vel .... meus parab√©ns
He's afraid!
Tom Hardy is the best!!!!!
Best surprise nomination by far!
What a great Movieüëçüëå
Fitzgerald is a badass!
He deserves to win..He was soooo goood!!
A disgraceful character portrayed by Tom Hardy.
Hardy, and everyone involved in this film should be winning awards !
Finally, tonight I get to see the film!! can't wait
Yes he was incredible, i hate fitzgerald.... hope to win, but sylvester was so adorable in creed.... but i want hardy to.win, can both win, a tie? hahaha
Great actor, he showed us the raw nature of a human being in such raw environment..
Great actor and wonderfal movie, but not for Oscar üòâ
When I saw this movie I predicted Tom Hardy would be nominated as best supporting actor .  The best movie all year and more than deserving for all its Oscar nominations and its time Leonardo Di Caprio is honored with an Oscar as well , long overdue! I am eagerly awaiting this years Oscars and all those rich spoiled sports boycotting can stay home for all I care , no one will miss them . They should be ashamed of themselves for their behavior trying to ruin the atmosphere of the ceremony for those well deserving of their nominations !
Se merece el Oscar, Tom Hardy
Wow! Love it...interesting. Real Interesting.
this movie 's taught me one thing ... stay alive no matter what... keep your head above the water and just breath... life is precious...
Great movie
He was amazing in this movie.
Tom Hardy: best underrated actor of the last 5 years
He'll win it or Jennifer Jason Leigh will lol
....I Regret  to inform you,  I could not  understand  most of his  dialogue.  There  should have been SUB Titles  for his  delivery.
Tom hardy & Leonardo Di caprio 
Both of them so amazing üòçüòç
turns out.. god is a squirrel!!!!
Hard-ly not to say he¬¥s the best......
go hardy and leo oscar time
This a great masterpiece movie!
Tom kicked ass in this movie, better than Leo I thought.
He was superb..remember he's from London...his accents are always superb...what a truly incredible film for all involved...go see him in legends...I'm from England so his cockney accent is no probs for me...but for u lot may be not...lol also a superb performance by Tom...cheers dcüòé üì∑
Blew my mind he did.  It's a win without doubt
There he issssss
Que buen actor Tom Hardy!!! Me encantan sus pel√≠culas.
First fell in love with Tom by accident watching him in  Wuthering Heights
Hardy did an amazin work. Gets to be hated. He deserves a Oscar. Bravo!
Great movie
Hardy's performance is way too overlooked by DiCaprio's. Don't get me wrong, Leo deserves every last bit of buzz he's getting, but Hardy was phenomenal too, and deserves this nod(and win! IMO). Loved this movie so much.
Na..he is a white guy
Tom is the man ‚ù§üëç
You deserved to win the best supporting actor award Tom Hardy. I so hated your guts in The Revenant Movie. You did your part so well
It's hard to say what was my favorite aspect of the film since it was so great in every category but I do believe Hardy's performance was one of the things I enjoyed most.
No one deserves to win this award more than him!
El si fue malo en la pelicula
I want a open world game of this movie!!!
Tom should win best supporting actor, hands down; great actor
I recently watched this movie and I have to say it worth the nominations Leo has a good presence all the cast were excellent the portrayal of the old west is terrific the bear attack  was truly amazing the fact that he survives it is remarkable
Damn! This guy is a bad ass alright!
Terrific performance.
Before the nominations, I correctly predicted (on this page) Hardy's nod. He is a MAJOR talent: an old soul actor whose future performances we can only thrill to imagine. May life always treat him kindly.
Leonardo Dicaprio he is the best !!üòçüôå.
Outstanding film, the director is a true visionary , Leonardo DiCaprio exemplified the range of artistic evolution with this performance as Oscar worthy, Tom Hardy as the villain should earn him best supporting actor , the film leaves you emotionally and physically exhausted , takes you in .
The guy you love to hate, not only for what he does to Glass but also what happens at the end.
ÿßŸÑÿ£Ÿàÿ≥ŸÉÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÉ ŸäÿßŸÑŸäŸà‚ù§ i hope  Leo to  win in Oscar he deserved that üòç‚ù§
I wanted Glass to kill him so badly, that's when you know how good was Hardy... Hope he wins
Would the movie be too adult for a 11 year old boy to watch with his parents?
I really hope he wins üôè
The 1971 film Man in the Wilderness tells basically the same story as The Revenant.
hardy and di caprio are great
Its true Man in the Wilderness is basically the same.  I always thought Jeremiah Johnson was the best movie of its kind, and still is.  This movie is right up there.  I was very happy with this one.  It is an amazing film, that in my opinion sweep the Oscars.  The scenery in this movie still is with me.  Tremendous Cinematography!
Loved it!
he was amazing.  needs to win
One of the greats!! <3
Casey Liffick lets have a date night and watch :)
He better win
May the Tom Hardy win what he truly deserves.
Excelente interpretaci√≥n. Hizo que lo odiara!
Buenisima pel√≠cula dura mucho pero vale la pena
I hope Tom hardy Leonardo DiCaprio and the director all get oscars they deserve it!!
badass film, just got out of the theatre right now
If Tom Hardy and Leo Di Caprio don't win any awards, I will be very shocked. It was absolutely brilliant and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. 5/5 stars:)
He was amazing!!! I would even say better than Leo! He deserves an Oscar
He did really good!
I hated him so much. waaaaaa
The Revenant Movie - What about IMAX - #India release date ?
DiCaprio miss cast yet again , might have been a decent film with the right person in the lead
Oscar to Tom Hardy!!!!!
Oppression, injustice, treason and retribution, hunger, cold, fear and Ashkhabad, xenophobia, harsh nature . ammazing film
OMG  One of the best movies ever Loved This Movie I so agree with this comment "The best movie all year and more than deserving for all its Oscar nominations and its time Leonardo Di Caprio is honored with an Oscar as well , long overdue!"
I am sorry. I wasted 2,5 hours watching this movie.
He's better than Leo in this movie I think
bear scene was the best!
OMG what a movie!!!!!!!!!!!
I was a background performer in this movie i have one close up shot of me. Loved my director and everyone that was a part of this amazing movie. gonna go see it tonight at sunridge mall tonight for 7. its a very emotional movie for me to watch. thanks canadian tire for giving me the time off to be a part of this amazing experience.
Saw the movie, go, Tom!
Weather so cold to realize the film but tom hardy is bestest congratulations
Wasn't my kind of movie but I can see why it deserves an Oscar. The scenery was also amazing. And best actor must surely go to Di Caprio.
De manera que Leonardo Di Caprio jam√°s es merecedor del Premio Oscar 2016. Di Caprio no pasa de hacer papeles de un malo rom√°ntico.  En Titanic le quita la mujer a otro tras de,mentir a Rosa ya que es un miserable desarrapado. Darle el Oscar por El Renacido, volveria a traer la mala suerte al cine como la muerte de James Horner,  que sin el el Titanic deja de ser Arte y solo por unos dolares mas.
Tamer Abdulla yalla
Has any one idea about the name of actor as pridger is?
He had awsome english :3
Tom and Leo are so deserving of the Oscar
Congratulation, excellent film. Photo, edition, production and Leonardo amazing acting.
The Indian fight scene at the beginning was phenomenal. Hope you win, Alejandro.
Stole the show
Turns out... God is a squirrel ...
Definitivamente una pelicula hecha con pasi√≥n y todo el coraje. Nos recuerdas que el amor es lo que nos sostiene, cuando si existe. Que manera de mostrar y hacernos ver y sentir las peores y  mejores virtudes del hombre. Te mereces todos los premios Alejandro y gran equipo!!! Los paisajes, s√≠mbolos y fotograf√≠a √∫nicos!!!
ok if Leo doesnt win an award...
best movie, ever... well worth it..
Di Caprio for President of USA
Marwa Saleh e2ry el nas ktba eh
The Revenant was superb! Amazing work. Leo and all the actors were great. I felt I was right there in the scenes. Leo you rock!
Excelente pel√≠cula! Excelente actuaciones de Leo DiCaprio y Tom Hardy! Me com√≠ las u√±as toda la pel√≠cula!!
That was Tom Hardy??!!!! What was asked of Tom Hardy , Leonardo Di Caprio and the rest of the cast across multiple locations is the center of the film's theme of how the extent of the cycle of violence of man and nature is no match for caring for another's dignity. "Mad Max" receives kudles for feminist film theory ‚Äî but The Revenant Movie is for every woman and humanity.
Tom is a great actor but the hard part in this movie was interpreted for Leo, tom hardy is one of the best interpreting as a villain but  honestly think about it, I don't  believe Tom would have done  Leo's acting better than him, Leo wins the Oscar he really deserves it! ‚òùüèºÔ∏èüëèüèºüôåüèΩ
Der wohl schlechteste Film den ich jeh gesehen habe
Excelente  pel√≠cula, √©l director se merece , ganar un Oscar, y para Tom, Hardy
Surviving in that weather was award winningüëç
Great accent Tom Hardy !! Truly american.
best of luck for Tom... he has been working so hard... love him... a kid w/principal for life...
Excellent film!
in course of view with Tom Hardy...Leo di Caprio..two great actors..of the world...can't wait...to appear in cinemas....
Tom Hardy went above and beyond in this film. I hope the best for him on oscar night!
Meanie! Just kidding. Great actor. :)
This film is Authentic .
two thumbs up for Tom  Hardy
Tom Hardy was great. Subtle, nuanced, and realistic.
Tom Hardy became his character
tom hardy gets off , and takes the whole movie
Lo odio tanto...  (Excelente pel√≠cula).
Leo needs an Oscar!!

Tom Hardy is unbeatable this year, if u dare, put a bet, no offense, kidding...he's gonna win üòä
Charlotte Reidl skal vi ikke se?:)
Man quality leonardo di caprio !
Fantastic move. ..I watched at Royal  cinema. .Delma mall.
Me encanta tu actuacion en √©sta peli... !!!
WE HAD A DEAL GLASS!...
This character was very complex for some reason he reminded me of Waingro from "Heat"
Amazing movie gritty and deep will be one to watch over and over
Es una Bestia....de lo mejor.......el Antagonista a la Altura del Protagonista.....es lo que hace grandes a ambos
Well deserved indeed Tom Hardy, you did a brilliant job
it's an amazing film . That my opinion sweep the Oscars.  TOM HARDY best underrated actor of the last 5 years
Um dos caras que j√° foi considerado us dos mais sexy,ficou horroroso s√≥ pra fazer esse filme,e faz um interpreta√ß√£o FODS √© pra tirar o chap√©u mesmo!!!
oh I  so hated him beginning to end Spitzberg! (not hte actor...the personnage lol) actor made me to
Me too he was the best Evil guy ever
Can a bear be nominated for an acting award?
Leo was outstanding, the entire movie was well done. Well deserved
Great actor! he`ll win the Oscar!
Tom hardy deserves the Oscar more than everyone! He is amazing in his acting!!!
Magical performance for tom hardy
I could feel the cold breath taking scenes.
Tom Hardy plays a great villain to hate, if Sly wasn't nominated Tom would win.  The Revenant should win every category it's in but that's my opinion and Hollywood hates popular picks
Stef Prz :) I knew it.
Compite contra Rocky. Lo veo dif√≠cil.
I swear, he's gonna get the Oscar! :)
He was great in the movie! His casual, sarcastic and menacing attitude was really performed well in the movie! He was as fierce as a wolf! Him smoking the pipe and being sarcastic really showed him to be coping with harsh territory and battling his own inner demons! Tom Hardy is one of the greatest actors ever and seems to be a great person!
they say the actor is good when you hate him and omg i hate him LOL what a movie!!!! loved it.  verdad Rosa Maria Coeto
He was sooooo good I wish I had a gun so I could shoot him for Glass !!
This film is over all Oscars,It is for a special award!
One of my favorite films so far this year.
Best film ever
This is an amazing movie, I hope it wins everything for what it has been nominated.
Love it! <3
It has my vote ! Hands down! Great Movie! Wonderful Actor! <3
I really enjoyed watching this movie. Amazing!
all i have to say is.... " Spectacular-outstanding applause.....
Best movie I've seen in years!! The bear scene takes your breath away!!
One of the greatest film achievements of our time
...The Revenant, Beasts of No Nation & Spotlight  we're  the  BEST Films of 2015. (In my opinion)   And I happen to be employed in the  Film & Television Industry.
Gaby Hernandez we HAVE to see it again!!!
I love this movie! Such strong and breathtaking images! Natural light and nature at it's best. Loved all the actors! What an amazing accomplishment!
I just saw it! the whole photography work by Lubezki is stunning, strong and breathtaking images, this movie is different in every way possible from all "ALL" the other movies ever! But I think you need to see it two or three times so you can really appreciate all and every single detail of this masterpiece.üëçüëçüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüòÉ
I really love the photography.I hope won Oscars in all nominations.
Alyssa This movie was truly epic; cinematography, acting, script, music, directing... it has EVERYTHING. If this movie doesn't win an oscar, and Leo doesn't win one, I am so done with the Academy.
And I don't if you guys agreed with me but Leo's ageless pretty face is gone GONE finally! With this role I'm beginning to see him very different. Hope he wins the Oscar.
The most boring movie I've seen in the beginning of 2016. Lol
Great movie also book.
Amazing documentary.  Must see if you loved the film.
I've seen it three times already and will keep going while on the big screen. One is able to take in elements not necessarily seen the first (or second) time. Have you ever fallen in love with a movie and kicked yourself for not seeing it again at the theatre? May I suggest to all: Once is not enough?
Leo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy were far beyond outstanding in their performances!!!!! They should sweep the house at the Oscars!!
Never will there be a better movie than this one is !!!!! Five Stars‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

Best Actor( Leo will win!)
& Supporting( Hardy!)

Just Amazing!!!!!
HOPE YOU GET AN OSCAR FOR EVERY OF YOUR NOMINEES!!!!
Just saw the movie The Revenant...a great movie that shakes people awake about forgiveness about karma and about that all what people do to us in pain and suffering. They will receive it back ten faults...

#Forgiveness

 Another movie about what we all should learn.

Forgive, because you will be forgiven in the same way you forgive others.

A must see movie about a must see truth.
Awesome movie!!
watched this movie this afternoon. AMAZING MOVIE!
Bien buena! La recomiendo
It's taken me two full weeks to realize #TomHardy is not a "bad guy" - just a #GreatActor!! Definitely OSCAR Worthy performance for #BestSupportingActor! ! !
WOW. This movie was amazing. Brutal, but amazing. Kudos to Hardy and DiCaprio!
great movie so enjoyed it
i still having no words for it it really took my breath away when i watch the views in imax   it definitely was epic and i loved the soundtrack and my fav scene actually the second was when Glass and the other pawna where they were both sticking out their tongues to the snowfakes and it turn out kind funny in a touching way if the director wanted to show the love bettwen fhater and son the scene they hug is perfect it touched me
excellent movie excellent cinematography, acting , all .... all ....each scene wow wow and more wow,!
Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God‚Äôs wrath, for it is written: ‚ÄúIt is mine to avenge; I will repay,‚Äù says the Lord. On the contrary: ‚ÄúIf your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.‚Äù Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

One of the best movies I ever seen.....
Akshay Chhabria this movie bro  üòç
Lord I went to see this movie the other night it seem so real I kept deciding if I wanted to stay or leave I give it a A rating that bear
An awesome #film! We are definitely routing for Leonardo DiCaprio and crew.
THE MASTERPIECE!!
"While exploring the uncharted wilderness in 1823, legendary frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) sustains injuries from a brutal bear attack. When his hunting team leaves him for dead, Glass must utilize his survival skills to find a way back home to his beloved family. Grief-stricken and fueled by vengeance, Glass treks through the wintry terrain to track down John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), the former confidant who betrayed and abandoned him." - - Reading this description I see that they are inventing this. Hugh did not have any family from all accounts of his life; he was originally seeking vengeance but after meeting up with John Fitzgerald he did not; actually what he wanted most of all was his rifle which he got back. Oh and the other person that was with him and abandoned him was Jim Bridger. Oh Hugh was part of a hunting detail when he got attacked. I wonder if they will show how he died. Too bad they did not use this book as the whole story (The Saga of Hugh Glass -- Pirate, Pawnee and Mountain Man by John Myers Myers) Still going to see the movie.
READING the book now.. will watch it after that.. let leonardo win
Acabo de Ver, No mejor dicho: Acab√≥ de Disfrutar y Extasiarme con esta Maravillosa Pel√≠cula: " THE REVENANT " del Mexicano y Compatriota: Alejandro GONZALEZ I√ëARRITU, y de Verdad, estos 156 minutos que dura el FILM, son Absoluta y Avasalladoramente DESLUMBRANTES y CONMOVEDORES, como ninguna otra de las decenas de Miles de Pel√≠culas que he visto. Tiene un Ritmo, una Temperatura, una Atmosfera tan Minimalista y Cautivadora, que NO hay, mil√≠metro a mil√≠metro del Celuloide, ni segundo a segundo de cada Escena Extasiante y Desafiante ning√∫n desperdicio. ES DE UNA SALVAJE y ESTREMECEDORA BELLEZA ABSOLUTA, Mucho, pero mucho mejor que las Novelas de JACK LONDON, como " Colmillo Blanco "...Sin duda alguna, El SUBLIME y MAGISTRAL Trabajo F√≠lmico que ha hecho, tanto, ALEJANDRO GONZALEZ I√ëARRITU, como EMMANUEL LUBEZKY en la Fotograf√≠a, quedara para la Posteridad, Eternizado en la HISTORIA DEL ARTE, como una de las M√°s Altas Cumbres de la Cinematograf√≠a de todas las √âpocas y Generaciones, y de un ARTE POETICA, Absolutamente MAGNIFICENTE..!! FELICIDADES !!!...!!! GENIAL y HERMOSA !! Como ninguna otra Pel√≠cula...Se podr√≠an, en Verdad, ESCRIBIR RIOS y ALUDES de Tinta de tantos Comentarios, Reflexiones Filos√≥ficas, √âticas y Po√©ticas que Despierta esta Brillante OBRA MAESTRA: " THE REVENANT " EL RENACIDO, y la Actuaci√≥n de LEONARDO DI CAPRIO, es, cre√≥, hasta Hoy su Obra Culminante: SOBERBIO, Humano y PODEROSO.

Merece definitivamente repetir el Oscar.

Beautiful masterpiece and I am blown away by this film! I'm so glad they won 3 Golden Globes and I really hope not only they take home all 12 awards on Oscars, but for Leonardo Dicaprio to win Best Actor and the whole movie to win Best Picture!
This movie is so damn awesome!!!!
does teh movie have ASPCA or HS approval ?    Where any horses really hurt or killed????
I got to say everything was perfect but the sound of this masterpiece is incredible.

One of the best films I've ever seen, and the best behind the scenes documentary I've ever seen.
wonderful movie ever
Wow. That was a great documentary.
one of the best movies ever seen
Just watched this yesterday and it was intense. Leo and Tom did amazing.
Yep, nature is alive. The western world is starting to remember this.....
Justin Helstien, can we watch this documentary soon?
If Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't win the Oscar with this one, it will be a shame

The Revenant was the best outstanding, spectacular, excellent cinematographer in any movie making ever ... High Five ..Nevermind.. make that High Ten.. :)
Highly recommed to watch this for future generations!It¬¥s learining!
Love every comment on here he is a great actor in every movie that he has made
it i s important to know the context of the lives of these characters and others of the past.......but this is just one slice of  life, back then (and now) There was and still is the mystery of honor among differing people groups. When honor is not upheld , yes then all hell can break loose. We are to respect others above ourselves "The Good Book" says......and in every culture that has ever been there was a moral compass. I enjoyed the spiritual aspect of this beautiful movie.  Thanks to those who try to set a moral compass in their lives, good examples for others to follow.
Alejandro G I√±√°rritu one of the greatest directors of our time!

Spectacular movie! Leonardo waiting for your √ìscar  !!!!
When an expedition of early 1800s fur trappers in the American Northwest encounters a bear while hunting, their scout, Zach (Richard Harris), is unfortunately mauled. Although Zach's wounds are treated by the medic, the leader of the troop, Henry (John Huston), believes he will die and orders the troop to continue on while Zach is left behind. But Henry has underestimated Zach's will to live -- he survives and manages to regain his strength, in order to track the troop and exact revenge.

The Native American Tribe in the film is the Arikara. Which means it took place somewhere around North Dakota, or Montana.

Incredible movie!!! Leonardo DiCaprio is the best actor..

Awesome actors & an in your face movie about survival in the wilderness of a time long gone!!
Good for Alejandro Gonzalez I.

Mesmerizing film, could watch it over and over and over and over again. Love Leo üòçüòçüòçüòç
Movie making as a spiritual experience. 'There is great meaning in these things, but when we would express it, words suddenly fail us.'

Gleeson.
It's one of the best movie I've ever seen in a very long time.. A+ all the way :)
This movie was outstanding ! I have not seen a movie for many years that was so incredible.The screenplay, director actors, music,and cinematography were amazing . This movie deserves to win any and every award.
I really liked his character, t was so sad what happened to him.
Love him üòçü§ó
Leo's performance was outstanding and he was supported by a strong group of cast members as well! I just knew this was a winner from the first trailer. Definitely purchasing on Blu-ray once it is available.
Oh General hux!
Bel film leo bravissimo come sempre
I had to watch it again....love it
Absolute great acting. Everyone was great
Absolutely amazing!!! I felt bad for the bear cubs.
Todo el tiempo sentada en la butaca con deseos de gritar COJONES que desesperacion!!! Qu√© manera de sufrir, DIOS!!! Una pel√≠cula inolvidable.
"The bear scene " how u guys did that
Daamn i love this Actor, i ve watched him the first time in Ex-Machina ,he is really talented actor,nd he is lucky too
Beautiful scenery... To much blood and cruelty shown in details .... Could not enjoy
Felicitaciones en Chile esperando la pelicula.
Domhnall Gleeson is a great up and coming actor, really liked his performance in The Revenant Movie. All four films he starred in 2015 are nominated for Academy Awards (The Revenant, Ex Machina, Brooklyn and Star Wars: The Force Awakens). Last year he was great in Oscar nominated Unbroken and also starred in Calvary and Frank which were among my favorites for 2014.
I've seen the film twice in one IMAX and is wonderful
Saw it for the second time last night. Second time on IMAX and it's quite a sight to see on IMAX. If you are going to see it and can on IMAX do so. You will thank me later.
Wow ! Tremenda pelicula, actor, efectos, y sonido , Felicidades !!!!!
The rising star
Wow, it's been years since the words came oUT of my, "Dam that was an awesome movie, I got to watch it again."
Leonardo is amazing
What a babe!
&The Revenant Movie, all the scenes were wonderful and the voice of Leonardo DiCaprio at the moment of this action, was incredibly! This is an OSCAR MOVIE!
Captain Henry
Best movie ever!
My favorite <3
Lisa Berndle, ¬øc√≥mo no lo encuentras bello?
I absolutely loved him in The Revenant!! And I still hate Tom Hardy for -well for everything he did so brilliantly bad in the movie- but also for scalping those wonderful red locks off of him...
I love him! I love his character the most in the movie ( sorry Leoüòù)
i thought he was faramir from LOTR. lol.
in reflecting on the movie afterwards with my son, we both said that "the captain" really stood out as a character -  with ethics and good judgement -  and for the actor who portrayed him. Now I know who Domhnall Gleeson is and he brought a lot of humanity to his role. He stood out! I must catch up to his other movies.
This movie was brilliant. BRILLIANT. Amazing work had by all.
was great
Mariana Acu√±a de esta no zafas, si o si!!!!!!! :)

Time to see what The Academy thinks next month. If Golden Globes are any indication. They're going to win a lot.
The best part to my personal opinion is when he let him go at the end. He knew that killing him would not change how he felt inside.
Congrats to The Revenant Movie best movie ever. hope for the best this year. Leo. great.!
Hope for the best this year Leo. best movie ever. thanks.!
Amazing movie.
Love you leo <3
This is a great movie & loved it!!
What a great movie. Beautifully acted and directed. Can't wait for the Oscars this year. One question though why did they keep calling the Indians Re?
Awesome movie and love the scenery
very good movie
loved it!
Amor Darik Sandoval est√° es la pel√≠cula que te digo, vamos al cine!!!
I have always loved Leonardo DiCaprio's acting. he is the best. I am so looking forward to see this movie, Thank you Leonardo DiCaprio, God continue to Bless you , guide you and protect you.
Great movie based on true events of Hugh Glass a 19th century trapper.  It's a winner all around.
One of the best film's I have ever seen! Amazing story, acting, picture wow (Y)
I think the movie is a good one certainly better than most movies but compared to other Inarritu movies I don't think it's even close to as good.  Lots of Hollywood cheese in there that surprises me from someone so singular in vision as Inarritu.  As far as Leonardo the acting is good and obviously went through a lot to film this.  I think Tom Hardy's part is the better acting job in the movie though.
Y a esta Karen Escoto üíô
I've seen this #Amazing movie #TheRevenant, & every time I see a trailer for it, I still have to watch it! EVERY SINGLE TIME!! Guess I should go back & see it AGAIN! ! ! A #MustSee ! !

when this movie is available in hindi? anybody knows?
The best movie
I have to tip my hat to Leonardo DiCaprio and the entire crew for taking on such a venture to bring us back in time and teach us how grateful we should be to have the comforts we have today! I have yet to see it...planning to own it when it comes out!

It's good but not the best.
Oj i to bardzo wkoncu!!
Read the book, saw the movie, will go see the movie again!
After reading two books on Hugh Glass and knowing the story way ahead of time, went to the movie today: A Great Epic Wilderness Adventure, easily of the Caliber of "The Big Sky", "Jeremiah Johnson", "A Man called Horse", "Dances with Wolves", "The Mountain Men," and of course "Man in the Wilderness" that is also about Hugh Glass. Couple of observations: Glass survived because his initial ordeal took place in summer not winter. He survived on bugs, rodents and roots. In his torn-up condition, he would have quickly frozen to death in winter. He also historically "danced with wolves" by himself to get the dead buffalo, thus getting all tore up again, so it should have been that way in the movie. I really wanted to see him fight them off the way Charlton Heston did in "The Mountain Men" that borrowed from this tale, so I was a bit disappointed. There were other things, but all in all, it pretty much proved that people today may think they are tough - but NOBODY is "Hugh Glass Tough!!" :D Sadly, I didn't catch any of the dialogue, because I'm too deaf to make out any of the words. Still a 100% great flick!  Great effort on everyone's part!!
DiCaprio?  He's now up there with the Studs of Old Time Hollywood - but can he stay there?  I sure hope so!!  Get him, Kurt Russell, and Val Kilmer together to Defend the Alamo - and this time do it all RIGHT!
Saw it tonight and loved it. Brutal but fantastic movie.
Saw it Friday! Good movie!!!
This was an EXCELLENT film, and #LeonardoDiCaprio was brilliant. #Oscar worthy for sure!! #thisisLeosyear ‚ù§Ô∏è
Great movie,a must watch  New  Zealand Black Powder enthusiasts . Brilliant acting Leonardo,  and hats off to the Director ..Dont  wait for the video a must see  on  the big screen.Dont forget the  Bear award   :)

Jamison Blank.. This is that Movie. I was telling u about ( LOOKS INTENSE-)üòÅ Looks cool I think.
Based on True Eventsüëåüèª.
Francis De Robles Nazareno eto ba yung tinatanung mo kagabi?
Great great storytelling ...
I feel so involved
Great movie. A must see. It is almost historically correct. It should have been filmed in the summer and the fight at the end never happened. Other than that it was a great educational movie. Keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through the movie.
And it absolutely deserved it! üëçüëçüëç
Nothing touches this film...nothing...masterful directing cinematography..and acting and cast absolutely superb..
I would have been surprised if any other movie won it.
The best for all üòä

Ever since Children of Men, I have been wanting to see more work by this cinematographer. He and the whole team exceeded all expectations in The Revenant.
Great movie! Great cinematography!
Almost in tears when leo was stuck watching his son get stabbed, and that ending fight was amazing!

Best movie I've ever seen 5stars‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
Best cinematography ever
Brilliant film all the way around.
If I have to give Oscars for this masterpiece, those are winning categories:
Directing
Leading role
Supporting role
Cinematography 
Editing
Original score (not nominated - wth?)
Movie of the year
Cinematography was the word I was looking for üòÇ Anthony Singh
Bear for Oscar
Hugh Glass never had a son...
I'm just curious, does the camera always moving make anyone else feel sick? I couldn't even watch the film because it made me feel dizzy. I know this type of filming will be the new norm, just feeling bad I will miss some great shows because if it. Maybe I need Dramamine! The rest of my family loved the movie.
Can't wait to this movie!!!!
I even liked the Bear breathing on the Camera Lens fogging it up and the blood splatter on the Camera lens when they were filmimg those secnes.
Cinematography on this one stands alone without opinion.  Obvious win.
When you hear a picture doesn't do it justice,well they got it on camera in this film!  May be the best I have ever seen.
Best picture !
Best movie in a long time, very well done
Absolutely have to make sure you see it on the big screen!!!
I just watched this. It was visually stunning.  I can't even imagine the time, planning and difficulty that went into creating this film.  It has my vote!!
This was excellent at all levels !
It is a Beautiful Film :)
Mr. Lubezki is an amazing artist.
Yes. Great depiction of survival
I guess it's going to be another Mexican year at the academy awards. Must be something in the water that's causing Mexico to produce so much film excellence.
Best for Oscar winner des
Loved the movie and isnt Canada beautiful?
Where was this movie filmed?    Mexico? ?   I thought it was in the Northern  Territories.    You know, having snow and everything.    Overall it's the best one yet.   Way to go congrats  Leonardo!  ‚ù§

When there is a storm, and you stand in front of a tree, if you look at it's branches, you swear it will fall, But if you watch the trunk, you will see its stability.
Tom Hardy deserves an award too.
He should have a Academy award already he better get one for this movie!
Elias Jones it's happening

Congratulations Leonardo DiCaprio, I am so looking forward to see this movie, God our Creator has truly blessed you Leonardo, may God walk with you, and continue to bless you.
Priyanka Pankajhawwwww my gaad
The best of all the best this year
One of the best!!!
You make history
Congratulations for the team  of The Revenant specially to Leonardo Di Caprio the best actor of the world .
Great movie! Congratulations Leo, you are a wonderful actor!
Tom Hardy helped carry that film too much.
Matt Damon carried The Martian
But the Oscar should go to:
Tom Hanks for Bridge of Spies. 
I don't think he got nominated, so I would vote for Matt Damon over Leo.
Hell yeah! He deserves all the award!
Not really a Leo fan, but I thought his performance was outstanding.
Love you, Leo. :')
Congrats Leo ‚ù§Ô∏è Oscar bound baby!!
THIS IS YOUR YEAR LEO!!!...
This IS the year for Leonardo DiCaprio All the way!!!!!!!
Now...that Oscar! C'mon.
Ray, let's watch this? :)

El mejor de la historia
I want to see this so badly.
keep winning my boy
Best movie best Actor .. You will take Oscar DiCaprio
Loved it...one of the Best movies made
Awesome movie. Don't go to see movies often, this one was well worth the price of admission!!
Brilliant movie. A couple of scenes in it that will never be forgotten. Some cinematography too.
Awesome movie!
Eman H. Bazlamit lets watch it!!
Es hermosa hay que verla
"He knows how far I came to find him."

DiCaprio OWNED that role.
Wow what a good movie.  Leo deserves to win an oscar
They will take Best Actor, Best Director & Best Picture and more LEAVE NO DOUBT!!!!!
I wonder what kinda savage his mom was.... Lol (Tom hardy)
The Revenant Movie tem imagens incr√≠veis!! E o som √© a voz de Deus!!
Anita Nylund skal vi fare √• se??????
Brilliant movie!!! Can't wait to see it again.
This entire conceptualization, screenplay, direction and most importantly Leonardo DiCaprio deserve an Oscar.... It's Epicness Loaded!! Pushing both brutal realism and extravagant visual poetry to the edges !
Awesome movie in my opinion.
Best movie EVER.  Leo better get the Oscar this time.  He deserves it.  Loved the part where he actually ate the Bison liver.  Brave man. Go see the movie.  You will love it.  Very, very, suspenseful.
Seeing Leonardo DiCaprio clinging to a piece of wood in icy waters, it never gets old!
Just saw it today! Was absolutely mesmerized by Leonardo DiCaprio! I had this same feeling last year when seeing The Theory of Everything with Eddie Redmayne, how both actors took such dedication for their roles both mentally and physically. This WILL BE DICAPRIO'S YEAR FOR THE OSCAR! But as much recognition that DiCaprio and Tom Hardy are getting for their roles, I felt some of the Native American actors should have been recognized, either the actor who played Hawk or the one who stays with DiCaprio's character after letting him eat some of the bison meat.
Love it,one of the best movies i've ever seen ! i already saw it twice and DiCaprio is really unbelievable with his intense performance, i felt his emotions every step of the way. #DiCaprio surely deserves the Oscar for this incredible movie!!
Leonardo ...Smart Actor ...!!!!
Who is the #amazing Native Actor who played the character who stayed with Hugh Glass, sharing the buffalo meat with him & caring for him?  Anyone..? #LeonardoDiCaprio #Oscar2016 #TheRevenant ! ! !
This is a remake of the Wilderness Man with Richard Harris. Good movie.
Impressive scene. .but they all were.
Wow! Saw it this weekend. So many intense scenes. Best actor on the planet. Leonardo DiCaprio owned the role. Genius talent.
üòÆüòÆ look great this movie at this time Leonardo have to win the oscar!!
FANTASTIC!  One of the best movies I have seen in a long time!
Great flick Leo and Tom are bad ass
May have been "Inspired by true events" but not all the events in the movie were 100% true. Fitzgerald was only 23 in 1823 when the movie was set (not in his early 40's) and actually died in 1854; Glass did not have a son; the events took place in Central South Dakota and no snow covered mountains in SD; events took place in May to Aug so certainly no snow in August. I could go on but won't. If you disregard the actual facts, it is a great Hollywood adaptation of a man's journey back from being left for dead. Cinematography is outstanding - felt as if you were right there. Only thing missing was smells and the severe coldness and wetness. [Too bad theaters cannot actually immerse the audience into those conditions.]
&Leonardo DiCaprio, this movie is wonderful! I don't find words to describe how much magnificent is The Revenant Movie. Again and again, over and over CONGRATULATION for everyone that do part of this incredible SUCCESS.
I saw this film today. What a great movie......it emplifies the art of all that's involved to create this movie.
And the Oscar goes to.... Leonardo DiCaprioüëèüëèüôåüèºüôåüèºüôåüèºüôåüèº
Thank you for such a great movie. Loved all the actors and everyone that work on this film. Would love to meet the make up artist. Great work.
Most amazing movie I've ever seen..... Five stars! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
Amazing film
Amazing actor
Saw this yesterday, awesome movie.
Kari Stcz still have to see it!
Very raw, yet beautifully done.  A masterpiece.
This was excellent at all levels !
There is an older version movie I can't remember the name of it.
Leo was amazing ... No dialogue needed ... You were with him every step of the way üëçüèª
Lol no Oscar for him thought üòÇüòÇ
This is the best movie I have ever seen.. Leonardo you are a LEGEND.. The Oscar is yours.. God knows you deserve 10 for this experience.. WOW .
Me encanto la pel√≠cula, es genial el trabajo que hicieron, Dios los bendiga
Best movie & best actor. The Academy must to give the Oscar to Leo, he's an amazing actor!!
Laura Landman
Humm only if my honey come with me
A week later, i still cant stop thinking about this movie.  Have read several books about explorers and fur trappers of that time....I have to say, today we are total wimps compared to what these men endured.  One of the best films I have ever seen !
Academy Award goes to LEONARDO DI CAPRIO. Finally. We feel it. This is your year.
In last scene when he went to kill bad guy whit his friend, friend should not get killed. Its definatly based on true events. In some made up story friend would stay alive. Leo worth of osscar. Definatly. :)
Sleeping in a horse!
Bear get Oscar
Congrats on the wedding wof if wall street üíì
i really loved the screenshots in this movie beautiful
Beautiful cinematography
Love this movie ....the best movie ever
I saw the Revenant for the second time yesterday.  I can't wait to own this movie.  Oh, and if another feminist tells me that I should hate this movie, because I am a woman, I am going to sick a Mama bear on her ass.  OMG.
Watched it and thought it was a very good survival show.
Still thinking about it too. Researching on the era
Love this photo.
Love love üíúüíúüôåüôå
SPECTACULAR Photography OF Mexican:  EMMANUEL LUBEZKY...!! VIVA MEXICO !!, he, he.
This movie will be known in history as one of the greatest such as Gone with the Wind, The Shawshank Redemption, Star Wars,  True Grit! A masterpiece!
I loved this masterpiece. I have seen it more than once and love all the history it is bringing out. Thank you to everyone that was involved in the making of this great movie. Great acting Leonardo, Tom, and all the wonderful actors and actresses. Loved every minute.
Love love love, going again tomorrow.

Amazing movie.
I loved it!!!
I hope Leo wins the Oscar.

Stunning film. Simply stunning.
We loved it Awesome üíúüôåüôåüôåüôå
Great movie
Loved it
Just saw this movie today (1/17).  I am not sure that the words "terrific" and "awesome"  adequately describes the movie or the acting, particularly by Leonardo DiCaprio.  If he doesn't win the Oscar for this performance, it certainly will be an injustice. The same  applies to the Oscar for Best Movie. I not be at all surprised to see this movie become a classic.
saw it today. holy cow what a great movie
Just an absolute brilliant movie.!!
Se ve exelente la pelicula . Felicitaciones saludos desde CHILE.
2 and a half  hours of a guy walking in the snow....not what I expected
"I'm not afraid to die anymore. I've done it already." best performance ever!!!
The ultimate will to persevere and the love of father and son. Moving beyond belief and a classic that will be cherished in the history of cinema.
I want to go see this Jimmy Knight
It will be great you come with the TR crew to the Argentinian premier on January 28th. Just to say "thanks" for all the big snow fueguinos kept for you to make the final shots. Such a honor! ;)
Stacy Brown this is the movie I was telling you about
Intense and my new all time favorite.  Wow.
When there is a storm, and you stand in front of a tree, if you look at it's branches, you swear it will fall, But if you watch the trunk, you will see its stability.
Leslie esta hermosa c: sin luz artificial, camaras imax, belleza natural, Hardy y DiCaprio, osos, k bonito, kemosion
Ken Mauri eto yun oh.
Amazing.  If he doesn't get the Oscar...I say...B.S.
Awesome movie!!!!! I just saw it tonight
You wont regret watching this movie ‚ö°
I saw this movie last week. The grizzly bear attack is good reason enough to stay out of the forest.
One of the best movies I've ever seen in my life!  My husband and I went to see it, and we were exhausted throughout the entire movie, but woah!!  It was worth it!  I was speechless...on the edge of my seat the entire time.  The cinematography, the special effects, the acting...and that bear scene though!!  The previews, trailers, and commercials for this movie did NOT do it justice.  If Leonardo or the director Alejandro don't get Oscars, well shame on the Oscar committee!!  Y'all gotta go see this movie.  Run, don't walk to see it!
I always root for Dicaprio. He deserves the Oscar, it is a god damn time he won. He is such a talent. This movie was just wow. I must watch it again. Still shocked about the bear scene, that was just epic.
Aya Osama just look at movies which l love ‚ù§
What does  REVENANT
What does Revenant mean?
Epic, Amazingly awesome jaw dropping movie!!
Best picture n best actor n best supporting actor at Oscar 2016!
Watched it last night, it was just incredible!

Leonardo DeCaprio - What an outstanding job you did in this film!  You deserve an Ocar for sure!  Great Story!  Loved it - Blessings <3
This movie was good. I didn't expect the grittiness of it but the R-rating should've warned me. Great performances by Leo, Tom, and Will.

The Very Best Movie!!!
WONDERFUL MOVIE !!!!
Just watch it :) The twelve nominations for the Academy are well deserved ! Don't miss it ;)
good stuff!!!!!
I didn't think I liked it (some of it was too intense for me to watch )but later that night,  I kept remembering the story and the set. The bear scene was incredibly believable and I think it was well done. Best supporting actor should have been for Tom Hardy, IMO.
Hes really a good actor
Brilliant film! It deserves to win a lot of awards at the Oscars not least best actor and best picture
I really want to see this movie but I am an animal lover. Someone said don't see it if you love animals. Was it really bad and what kind of animals? The movie looks amazing and Leo is such a talented actor. Thanks for any input.
a must see :)
I just saw the movie. It was very good. I couldn't believe the bear scene. It evoked major emotion in me. It was a very intence movie. He was excelent in it. It also showed the love and devotion between a father and a son.
Best movie of the year!
This movie was awesome and he was amazing truly a great performance thumps up üíúüôåüôåüôåüôåüôå
A few brutal parts indeed to see but the will to survive is what is amazing
Aline Gabriele mostra para o Arlei e avisa que esse ano o Oscar vem! Hahaha
Oho this scene , bear scene was incredibly. .again I say don't miss
Excellent Film from start to finish. Only thing is, the Dialogue Replacement for the Native Languages was pretty bad... although they did the best anyone couldve done with ADR
Outstanding in every way. Just astonishing- Leo deserves it all!!
He deserves to win best actor. I never realized how good of an actor he was until this movie. Great job Leo and the other cast members as well!
Brilliant film and deserves brilliant audience.
Absolutely amazing! To all of you that worked this show......Epic!!!!!! Nice work!
Don't forget the popcorn have a good night guys
Saw it last night. Outstanding. Leo Deserves an Oscar.

Marina Prat Duran
Amazing movie & amazing actor...
Was somewhat disappointed in realizing I was watching a remake of Man in the Wilderness
Loved it. GO SEE IT!
The Revenant Movie WILL win the Best Picture Nomination. I just hope The Academy will also give Leonardo his well-deserved Oscar for the amazing perfomance he gave in this movie. Hats off to Mr. Inarritu as well for his fabulous work as Director, and Mr. Lubezki, for that jaw-dropping cinematography.
This was just such an amazing Movie!!
Really good movie recommend highly
What a great movie!
Good movie
i love you
I just saw this on Friday, and it was so good. I recommend it to everyone.
I saw it today, I really liked it. Very intense.  Good luck, Leo, I hope you win the Oscar, you've earned it. The other actors were also great.
Saw again today.... Never will there be a better movie ever! Amazing in every way - Five stars‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
disappointed in the movie..  seen it today.. dont think he had 25 lines .. the other actors were much better..  was ready to go  half way through..  and ppl i was with was to..
Trash movie. All about blood and violence and a cliche revange story. DiCaprio actually barely speaks!   It almost go all the time moaning and dying. The end is so obvious üòí
Amazing movie
I was exhausted by the time this was over....just worn out.  GO SEE IT !!
the scenery was beautiful
I loved it best movie of the year!
This movie!! Liliana Soto üò¨üòÅüòÅüòÅ
Finally got to see it. Outstanding
WOW!!! great movie!!
Very disappointed in the movie because most of the movie is about watching Leonardo crawling in the snow...waste of money.
Great movie!!!
I thought it was terrific! It was a true story for goodness sake! That man went through a lot!
nice story really  sad story
Omg. What a challenge making that movie must have been. The emotion was raw. The weather was treacherous. The terrain was uninhabitable.
To all the people putting this Movie DOWN. You are the people that don't know the first thing about what a Masterpiece is.
This Movie is without a dought a True Cinema Masterpiece.
Leonardo DiCaprio is a truly wonderful gifted Actor. 
Tom Hardy played a really good Villain. To pull off a role where you hated him for leaving Hugh Glass half dead and left for dead in a shallow grave.
Wow that was amazing to play such a role. 
And another thing you Movie haters are forgetting Leonardo DiCaprio learned to speak another language for this Movie.
This Film will go down in history as one of the BEST Movies made of our times.
Thank you Leo and Tom for bring this movie to the Big Screen.
In the last couple of years there has been some good movies.
But in all honestly not worth going to see at the theaters.
The Revenant was and is why we go to the Theaters.
Great movie, and Leonardo's performance was outstanding, as well as this film‚Ä¶ so well done from the acting to the directing to the cinematography.  This film deserves awards for best picture, as well as Leonardo's performance.   Best wishes!
Lily Rivera ehhhhhhhhh. Poor Jack!
That was some of the BEST acting and action on screen I HAVE EVER SEEN!  Kudos üëç
If Bear Gryllis and Dances with Wolves had a baby it would be the Revenant. Just saw it. Terrific acting, gorgeous scenery...but not something I'll ever watch again. Too much gurgling saliva dialogue for me.
I didn't know it was playing in IMAX!!! Sold!!!
Best. Movie. Ever
You felt his emotions every step of the way. Great movie and Leo if U don't win I'm going to be pissed. You deserve it for being my favorite actor your performances hit you hard and this is one movie I will never forget. You took me back to the 1850s and I felt I was seeing it all through you so thank you for being you and win that Oscar!!!
Awesome movie!!
I enjoyed the movie. It was long...but I never got bored. All he endured, was amazing. Really good acting by all. DiCaprio rocked!
OMG great movie.
Best movie .. Best actor <3
This movie had me in tears. Leo did such a great such a great job. I can't wait to see the bear or the kid from "We Are The Millers" win the Oscar.
That was tje best movie ive ever seen.
What language did LDC learn?
Great movie!
And the OSCAR goes to Leonardo  Dicaprio üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª at least 5 Oscars will win this one
A Masterpiece! Everything was well done to the minute detail. Bravo!
From A - Z a very authentic movie, just fenomenal, for me one of the best movies ever!
wow .. loved it CONGRATS BRO
The Revenant Movie WILL win the Best Picture Nomination.
That bear scene  was intense...great movie
The movie was amazing. Leo better win an Oscar for his performance.
Inarritu is amazing, strikes again...
Next time you think you've got a rough life go see this
We're going to see this Tuesday..
I am going to watch it this weeküëç
lets just change that to WINNER...shall we?
Beautifully done.
I don't see how this movie could win an award. Other than for filming in tough conditions. The movie is mostly shot in dark conditions, the main actor hardly talks, the actor " Fitzgerald" does a better job of acting. I love the stories from the Mountain Men that were the first in the west, and this movie is far removed from the things we know about Hugh Glass and Fitzgerald. Definitely not something I will add to my collection of Mountain man library.
This movie could have done just as well in under 2 hours.  I've seen 2 2/12 -3 hour movies in the past that were worth the time. Lincoln comes to mind.  A good movie, not a great movie IMHO.
This movie brought me to tears, made my heart race, and made me so passionate about Glass and Hawk. Phenomenal movie, it deserves all the awards it can get.
I want that two and a half hours of my life back
go for it Leo!
Excellent Movie!!!!
Tom Hardy should definitely win best supporting actor
Leonardo DiCaprio is at least four of these behind...Academy Award 2016 Nominee Best Actor for The Revenant Movie
A masterpiece!!! Hollywood at it's best...
Leo deserves to win for this! Awesome acting skills
no me la pierdo por nada , la voy ir a ver al cineeeee....
Did i mention crawling 200 miles thru rugged mountain terrain?
True survival movie. Very good.
Kyla Moore you wanna ride a horse
My hubby and I saw this movie this morning. What a powerful movie. Very little dialogue, so much raw emotion. Some of the scenes were gruesome but the beauty of the scenery soothed  away the gruesome. Leonardo is an extremely talented and gifted actor. Not wanting to give away the end, I choose to think he found " strength at the base of the tree". Congratulations to all involved in the making of The Revenant!
This was an amazing movie. Great, Great acting. Our white ancestors were really screwed up.
So looking forward to see this movie, Thank you Leonardo DiCaprio, for the movie, God Bless you.
James...... And you have to watch this and tell me what you think
Awesome movie I saw it a couple weeks ago !
Good efin movie
The movie didn't even need many lines, that is powerful!
John Paul Spadaccini is this the movie you were talking about?
No one is denying that the cinematography is oscar worthy and the villain character was played very well but honestly other than that the movie left for more desire.  It was completely over exaggerated.  There was a lot of Hollywood embellishment which is often done but in this case detracted from the story instead of add to it the way Titanic did with the made up love story.  By this I mean the whole relationship with the son and the death of the son as well as a bunch of other over exaggerated stuff  I also didn't feel this was dicaprio's best performance.  It felt a little forced for some reason and I think he's a great actor but don't feel it was at the level of the Aviator or Blood Diamond.
Bloody brilliant film.
This movie was based on man's existence and survival in the late 1800's. How a man goes to work outside his home and do not return for months or not return at all because he can get killed in so many ways. His office is the forest and what it offered. There were no high rise offices back then, no cars, no roads. Watching this movie made me realized how lucky I am to live in 2016. I make my husband his lunch and he comes homes after work in our warm house.
Best Movie ever! Can watch it over and over again. Love Leo ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Ba da MultƒÉ reclamƒÉ .DacƒÉ era filmul romanesc se fƒÉcea o reclamƒÉ ???
Fantastic! I love it and have watched it 3 times now.
I just saw it for the first time with my mom. We both liked it.  I rate it 10/10.
A toda la gente que pone esta pel√≠cula abajo. Ustedes son la gente que no sabe nada acerca de lo que es una obra maestra.
Esta pel√≠cula es que sin una verdadera obra maestra del cine.
Leonardo Dicaprio es un talentoso actor verdaderamente maravilloso.
Tom Hardy jug√≥ un buen villano. Para llevar a cabo un papel donde t√∫ lo odiabas por dejar a hugh vaso medio muerto y dejado por muerto en una tumba poco profunda.
Vaya, ha sido incre√≠ble para desempe√±ar esa funci√≥n.
Y otra cosa que los enemigos del film es Leonardo Dicaprio aprendi√≥ a hablar otro idioma para esta pel√≠cula.
This gonna be the BEST picture and BEST actor
Ride Along 2 ·¥¥·¥∞ ‚úî Full Movie

Jean Pierre D' Meza Jonathan Caban
Best film .. Love it <3
amazing movie, had me on the edge of my seat the whole time!
So touching to see that a father could care so much about his child. Then, to watch him  endure horrific circumstances to confront his son's murderer. The bitter cold, trying outdoors, and the intense emotions of the characters, are truly depicted in this film.
Great movie
LOVE THIS!
Can't waitüòÑüòÑüòÑ
Loved this movie!
Inspired by true events is a long long way from being the truth.
SORRY Worst Movie ever since Tom Hanks and Castaway !!!  Jeremiah Johnson -- Robert Redford 1972 a MUCH Better movie !!
besttttttttttttttttttttttttt movie of my life..
Man Tom Hardy looked scary in this.
Very Best!! A Delight of Vist!!!
Leo and Tom were amazing.  Great movie.  they need to win.
Nice movie üëç
BEST EVERYTHING...THE REVENANT WILL SWEEP THE OCARS!!!!!
Remarkable achievement. It's stunning in every way.
This movie was to long. They needed to cut the whole weird flash back parts out of it.
Loved it!!!! Leo was brilliant!!
He must take the Oscar this year!
Jessica Johnson it wasn't even that graphic hahaha
Loved this movie and Leonardo hit it out of the park...
We're going to see this Tuesday.. can't wait.. Love Leonardo..

This movie was beyond amazing! I can't wait to watch it again for a second time tonight!
Leo has done better work but then he is due for an Oscar
Excellent movie, amazing Leo :-) I believe that I¬¥ll hear on February 28: "The best actor in a leading role is Leonardo and the best picture is The Revenant".
Just a beautiful film!
omg what a movie
Will win best actor in the world <3
How long do I have to sit in a Imax theater watching this movie ?
He is the best actor ever and  i m  so excited  to see the movie
I've seen it twice now and could easily watch it again. Amazing movie!!
I have just arrived home from the cinema. :) Totally amazing!!
We are going in now to see this.
so beautifulls baby i love you Leonardo DiCaprio<3
Amazing film
Fantastic film! Hope Leo finally gets his long overdue Oscar.
I watched it last night!  I'm still thinking about this film.
His lifetime role!
Juan Carlos Ovando dude! Can't wait till next Friday!
And the Oscar goes to ... The Bear.
A beautiful movie i would love to see it on a good quality tv at home the picture the nature is amazing stunning. There is not much dialog in the movie and you remain connected to it, right until the end. The picture talk to you. There is no need to keep your mind occupied with meaningless words.  I would love to meet the mind behind this amazing film. A profound person that is real and truly feel and that also have the capability of transmitting  part of is soul to the audience. That beautiful soul surely can make this world better. Thank you to the creator you took me back in my childhood with the nature the pictures. The rivers the snow the evergreen. As if you had read my mind.
A beautiful awesome movie..
omg, saw this last night, it's totally EPIC and Leo you so deserve an OSCAR for this one, unreal acting, superb performance.  Thank you for a movie my grandson and I didn't want to end.
This movie is not Oscar material.  DiCaprio barely speaks through the whole film.  Nice location shooting in Canada, but rest of the movie is predictable and dull.
I loved this film. Riveting film. Best Picture!!!
Not that great. Started off good but then got predictable and boring.
A beautiful scene.
great movie
Love the love of a father he shows in this film. Great actor.
Absolutely fantastic movie!!
Awesome Movie !
I have not seen this movie, but intend to. I'd say, Leo did a great job if he can give such an amazing performance for, "barely speaking".
Love the whole movie....the script was amazing as was the acting!
Wish this movie wins best picture and of course best actor!
Absolutely fantastic film, and I'm tough on movies. If Dicaprio doesn't win the Oscar for it, then it's very unfairly rigged to a higher degree than we thought.
This is an incredible movie in every way, Leo, and the other actors, the cinematography, the story, just WOW!!!
He needs an Oscar for this and should have had one by now... very under rated actor
The bear deserves the Oscar
Gut wrenchingly good movie. Deserves every award and then some.
This film is awesome !
Leo should definitely win best actor.
Best movie I've ever seen! Gust great!
Cant wait to see it
I liked it. Great photography.
The movie is very intense.  DiCaprio really worked his butt in this movie. He deserves to win the Oscar.
After watching The Revenant: Leonardo doesn't deserve an oscar, neither does his movie!
It renewed my faith in the power of the human spirit and what one can accomplish.
Awesome movie, love Arthur Redcloud performance!!
Jeffrey Kim :D
Haunting, disturbing and so beautiful. This film has the power to leave it's mark in your soul.
I think I need to see Leo fight a bear.  ;)
Whats it about?
Can't say he will win a oscar but deserves one.
A real touch from Leonardo ,,I appreciated
Amazing!! Definitely best actor Leo!!
Laura Wyss
This movie is a Masterpiece!
Daniel T Leon Great one, u gotta see it.
AMAZING! My eyes and my heart have lived every scene...
Great movie, great acting!!
Bella pel√≠cula ,Di Caprio el mejor actorüåπ
Could somente tell me if he is dead at the end ?
Awwwww <3 I loved this <3
no me la pierdo por nada
Going to see this tomorrow, can't wait üëçüëçüëçüëç
Some people obviously don't know what a great movie is and what's worthy of an Oscar. I can say that this movie is Oscar worthy and then some. Leo's best work to date....period.
Such a good movie
As a film & music critic, I cannot find the English words to describe how phenomenal & truly inspiring Leonardo DiCaprio is, because clearly there are no words for such an amazing genius. You are larger than life on the big screen and even larger than life in person, fighting for the Environment. Bless you, Leo.
This is absolutely one of the most emotional scenes i have ever seen in a movie. Thanks Leonardo DiCaprio for the great movie. You are an #inspiration
Cecy Ariz - tell erik to take u... now.
In the book there was no kid? Haven't seen the movie yet but wonder why they added the kid in the movie? The book was great!
great Leo , you deserve Oscar for this great movie
i loved it so much ..Great job leonardo !
Amazing Picture !!!!!!
the most amazing film for this year üò¢ leo what have done to us u touch our motion with this globel performance ..all my support to this wonderful peace of art and the Oscar should go to this amazing team and amazing actors
Jurema Correa show √© bem o seu estilo.üôã
Excelente drama y una gran actuaci√≥n de Leo DiCaprio... Amazing!!!
loved this movie
Best movie of 2016
Fantastic movie
Great movie. Drove 50+ miles on New Years Day to see it.
Oscar. . Would love to be your next project. . Go Bucks. .
saw this recently...wow..incredible...and all the nominations.....the best movies this year,just came out recently/..
This is a great film of 2016, I love it.
Amor Lazaro Olvera vamos a verla o como vez?
I love this movie. I hope they win all nominations
Just finished watching.  Omg superb acting, scenery wow.
Steve and I just saw this movie. Intense. Leonardo DiCaprio deserves every award possible for this role.
Brilliant! Leo Dicaprio deserves both the Golden Globe and the Oscar! No doubt!!!
Left the movie early. Couldn't stand anymore stale scenes. In my opinion the movie could've been great but it only needed to be 2 hours long & I don't even know how it ended.
Great Movie
REMAKE DEL FILM DE 1971 ??? "THE MAN IN THE WILDERNES"?????...IS VERY SIMILAR....HUMMMMM
I loved it !!
Nothing to do with real story,guess I didn't get hollywoods take...love history,not deep meanings!
Leo deserve an Oscar this year! This role is amazing incredibile and so demanding. Come on Academy!!!!!
Ismael Romero esta es la pel√≠cula que dec√≠as que quer√≠as ver?
Horrible !! It's a guys movie.
Great director, Great cinematographer, Great Film
Fantastic movie
God...wat a movie..best of best ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ
Great movie!! Must watch
Can't wait to see this movie!!  It is going to be fantastic.
This violent movie just went on and on.. Di Caprio should have died in the first 10mins... But he's a cat with 9 lives! 
It's implausible that he would have stayed alive after the bear mauling and falling on top of him!!! And no he didn't die of blood poisoning which in real life he would have a day or two after the mauling...falling off a cliff into a 40 meter high tree then onto the snowy ground --- I thought he's definitely dead- but no just gets up and on with it.... By the end of the film I couldn't wait for him to die! I don't know why he made the statements at the Globes had nothing to do with the film...a pity.
I was impressed with the camera work.
This was unfortunately very slow and boring.  Most of the time Leo spent crawling in the snow, looking for food or sleeping.  I do hope he finally wins an Oscar though.
Great movie - Leonardo DiCaprio deserves an oscar for this
Awesome movie. Leo rocks!! The bear scene was so intense I felt everything with him
Did that poor horse die during the production of the movie???
leo will win his first oscar for sure!
Best cinematography in the history of movies !!!!
Mowlid!  You got to see this movie.
One of the best mahn.
omg what a movie
i am 2 tard.
Cant wait to see this one again! One of the best I've ever seen.
Was not a fan of this movie. It was basically a remake of The Gladiator, set in the 1800's, dream sequences of the main character's dead wife and all. Excessively violent and an hour too long. What happened to directors who know how to use an audience's imagination to add to the suspense and drama of a movie?
Amazing movie, Innaritu strikes again...
does anyone really survives when you are inside the horse skin?
Such a badass movie!!!
Great director, Great cinematographer, Great film
The description reminds me of John Houston's "A Man called Horse". Is this a remake of that film?
Finally! Waiting for the movie to start. I know Hollywood took there liberties with the story that's what they do. I really enjoyed the book.
Can't wait to read the book !
It's gory but the best movie I've seen in ages!
What a horrible, long ass piece of crap movie! I was so excited to see this, maybe that's why I am so disappointed.  I love Leonardo DiCaprio, but he couldn't save this story. Only plus...the cinematography was excellent. The ending must be one of the top 5 stupidest endings that ever came out of Hollywood.
The best actor in the movie was the guy who played Fitzgerald.
Just got back from seeing,it was great. Better than that fairy tale bs, and based on real men!
Es ist ein Film um zu unterhalten der gut gemacht ist. Es werden viele Details des harten Lebens eines Mountain Men gezeigt. Die in der Historie erbrachte Leistung von Hugh Glass war schon beachtlich.
Mario Guillen Tovar toca cine
went to see it and you could hear a pin drop thro the whole movie, cant get it out of my mind. a clasic? your dam right
Movie of the d Year!
This was excellent at all levels !
Where there is?Lake Minnewanka?
If this man cant win oscar again this year I dont really know what could he do better??we support you Leo from turkey!
Love This!!!
Leo did a fine job but it was too long!  A lot of unbelievable things, I felt.   All the time spent in the water one would think they would have had hypothermia, if not became a human icicle.
Awesome movie!
Gonna see it saturday
Amber can't wait for Wednesday üò±
Good show.
A perfect film.
Kudos to Leonardo DiCaprio for working with our Native Americans. Speaking from a full blood Native American,  Leonardo definitely deserves the Golden Globe award. Next well be Oscars!
GREAT Movie !!
Both acted superb in this. I hope they both grab the Oscar.
OMG... bear... holy hell that scene is so hard to watch
I went to see The Revenant today, it is a fantastic film and I would gladly watch it again, it is the most Un-hollywood film created by Hollywood in a VERY VERY VERY long time. I have even now added it to the list of the top 10 movies of all time. Nothing is perfect, my only criticism, it could have cut one of the scenes near the end, as the movie maybe went on 5 minutes too long. Finally unless there is an extrordinary performance in another film, I think Di Cappario is shoe-in for the Academy Award his performance was on par with Forest Whitaker in Last King of Scotland and Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man i.e. just hand him the statue.
Oh and I now want to visit Montana even more.
Good movie.  Tom did an amazing job acting.  Seriously impressed.  Leo was great as always.
Love tom hardy , he's a phenomenal actor and easy on the eyes and the same to you Leo !!! I hope and know you will get this Oscar and I hope they honor Tom as well
Best Film, so good
Great flick
We loved the movie!! We live in Wyoming and the conditions are AWESOME and FOR REAL!! Can't wait to see it again and again it is breathtaking! üòÉüòÅüòç
Saw it in IMAX yesterday and it was beautifully shot, felt authentic and was an all around excellent film. I especially loved that they got the casting right.
That voice!!!!! Tom Hardy!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüòäüé¨ü§ìüòç
stupendous movie
Cuando se estrena en mexico
Irai Duque Sobrinho quer ver em my House em HD ??? hem hum ham
A lot of "unbelievables".  Buffalo/wolve scene was horribly fake cg.
ESTE FILM LO HE VISTO ANTES..... EN 1971 CON RICHARD HARRIS.....
Vaughn Howard so this is the movie ur dad was in
I am surprised that The Revenant was not nominated for Adapted Screenplay...to make it 13 nominations!
It would be better if Tom hardy won oscar along with Leo and Alejandro. "The real 3 KINGS"
Awesome movie
Best actor in this world ..
Leo dicaprio <3 <3 <3
too bad it's not yet released in here :(
Jean Pierre D' Meza Jonathan Caban Ryan O'Callaghan
oscar oscar and oscars
Loved it
Cant believe our theater isnt running this film.
A must see
Tommy Reece this is a cool teaser
i will see it today, can not wait to see the dynamic duo of Dicaprio and Hardy in actiom
If he does not win a oscar for this roll  the whole oscars can suck it
I need to see a behind the scenes making of doc on this movie. How they pulled off the bear mauling was amazing to me. The realism of it was astounding, and completely absorbing. By the time he flew  down the mountain with the horse I was a little desensitized by the awesomeness of the bear mauling scene, but that scene stood out as well as many others. A riveting, special movie.
I have to say I wasn't blown away by Leo. I don't know why but I just wasn't this time around. Tom Hardy on the other hand gave me the chills. And whoever was in charge of cinematography made me as a photographer look bad. Breathtaking stills.
TJ O Sullivan when are ya takin me  üòÇüòÇüòÇ
A brutal dramatic,intense , powerful Movie I EVER seen before......................... 10/10
D√≠dac, el 5 de febrero tienes una cita conmigo y con Leo.
Back in the late 1800's did they even know what the effen himer was?¬† They seemed to curse a lot also.¬†¬† I am sure Hollywood stretched the facts to make it interesting, but if a person went into the water as much as the people in the movie did, wouldn't they have succumbed to the elements.¬† They often had fire immediately.¬† I liked the plot and the acting was top notch but some of the movie expected the audience be a little ignorant.¬† Just how I felt, it appears many amateur reviewers thought it was the best movie ever.
espero con ansias el estreno de una obra maestra de i√±arritu
One of the Best movies of All time!!
Great movie üëçüèªüëçüèª
Just saw it . very hard cold sad unforgettable movie
An incredible movie. Still think decap shoulda won for the aviator/ wallst. before
Eri √áelaku  sipas kritikave Tom did an amazing job acting ..kur do shkojme ta shohim? üèÉüèªüòéhahaha
Such a great movie!
Too early...
he finally won,  such a great actor and movie.
Nothing touches this or him at the Oscars.
Next, the Oscar.
Now let's go for the OSCAR!
Saw it today. I can't describe it with single words... A masterpiece... Leo, Hardy, Chivo, master Inarritu and everybody... Thanks for making this eternal masterpiece... I can't even say a word while the credits. Thank you <3
Looks as good as Lady Gaga booty. Much love
amazing film!!!
Loved it.
Leonardo best movie ever I watch 4 times ..
Well deserved!
Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor and The Revenant is an excellent movie!
Good movie, Leo needs to win an Oscar!
Excellent movie!üëè
Incredible that with such little dialogue, this movie kept me sooo intrigued! I loved it, Leonardo definitely deserves to win the Oscar. Such a fantastic actor. Totally recommendable movie, a thousand times recommended!
Well deserved ‚ù§ dicaprio
best actor in this world
Very deserved! MR ACTOR!!!!!! SUBLIME!!!!!! Lol! (y)
Such a fantastic movie! No wonder Leo won Best Actor - he was brilliant!!!!
An epic movie that suots him well!
Eagerly waiting for this movie to be released in india
Damn this movie was incredible. The acting, the cinematography, the location, the Native actors, everything was just perfect.
Best Movie this Year !!!
the best movie ever (y)
ppl complaining about the plot but they fail to realize that the magic is whats not being said. its all on the screen. pure art imo.
i love this movie
Leonardo Dicaprio deserves to win the oscar in this film. He is an excellent actor and acts incredebly good in this movie. (y)
üëçüëçüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè Excellent movie! ‚ù§ üòö
Amazing that Leo DiCaprio  dedicated his Golden Globe Award to protect indigenous people! :-)
My winnerüòö
How on Earth was the sequence with the bear filmed? Sheer magic. This has got to be an Oscar winning performance.
Well deserved!!!
Defiantly deserves it!!
Congratulations my very favorite actor of all times!superrrr
the best movie ever
What an excellent movie! It was the best movie ever and you deserves to win in the Oscar! Congratulations Leonardo DiCaprio! Your a brilliant actor! üëèüëç
I'm still baffled how is Tom Hardy up for only supporting actor? Without him you have no movie. I liked Leo's performance but him grunting and barely talking throughout the movie is hardly a reason to win an Oscar. I get that's how it was in the book and they wanted to keep true to it, but Tom Hardy stole that movie.
Golden Globe then Critics Choice. Next stop the Oscar. Love love love this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing üèÜ
Amazing one üëçüèªüëèüèª
TE LO DIJEEEEEE Arlette Morteo
Remy ska vi se den ? üòÄüòÄ
Leo, you'll win your Oscar, good luck!
The Revenant is an amazing movie with an exciting plot and breathtaking views. By playing this role, Leonardo DiCaprio opened all the facets of his natural talent by showing how the will power and lust for life can literally bring the man back to life.
Great movie. Great actors "-"üòå
Vu en AVP ce soir ... Tr√®s bon film ... Oscar √† pr√©voir pour LDC
Abdi Baxter tuh are mein... :'(
And tbe Oscar goes to tom hardy
Tag toh kr :P
waiting its India Release
The Movie deserves all the Awards.
And the Oscar goes to the bear....
Magnificent film!
Arthur did a great job in this film.
damn good movie. didnt think Dicaprio could pull off being a mountain man but he did
Wat een saaie langdradig rot film . Erg onrealistisch 
Eerst vechten met een beer( wat normaal niemand overleefd) dan meerdere keren in ijskoud water en nog is ie niet dood gevroren...verhaal is in de loop der jaren denk ik sterk overtrokken 
Pfffff...geen Award waardüôÉ maar mensen niet boos worden is gewoon mijn mening.
Wat wel gaaf is....is de methode van filmen........ik heb nog nooit gezien dat de camera's beslaan van het uitademen van de hoofdrolspeler........beetje tarantino achtig...heel vet! :)
A must see survival movie.
powerful film that deserves oskars
Wow, engrossing, graphic, a little long but definitely deserves Best Actor and probably Best Movie!
The best movie!
Will win .. And best actir <3
The best movie.. A good actor Leo..
Since avatar I have not seen a movie this good they deserve all the oscars üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
Leo DiCaprio AND Arthur Redcloud both brought the world such a cool message of love! I loved the touching portrayal imbedded in such a tough rough guys man vs. man and nature! Wow!
THE BEST SHOW I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY WHOLE LIFE.THAT'S OVER 5 decades.LEO you're the BEST
I have described this exact shot to several people. Love it!

Best Movie ...... Leo plays a great role ..... Made me cry ...... AEWSOME
movie is awesome...
Jessika Moran Rodriguez  i wanna see this babe looks good
The Bear should get supporting actress
I thought this was a very dark movie. It seemed to demonize generally l white men. And made fun of God. I personally wished I didn't waste the time. However I think it was a true warning at the end
Best movie !!üëåüèªüëåüèª
Most of today's movies disappoint me, not this one, best I've seen in years.
Yaya Rod
I couldn't stand t was just blood guts n gore to violent for me!
As amazing as this movie was, I have zero complaints. But the Martian exceeded my expectations and Matt Damon stole the show in that one.
How easy is it for Hollywood to fake you out...this movie is the same as Man in the Wilderness..with Richard Harris..Aliens came from It came from Mars...
That was a good movie.
Raegan Spruce Sunday night babe üòª
Awesome movie
good movie but a sad one
A more intense version of man in the wilderness üëçüëç
Julie Martin you and Chris Martin need to go on a little date night and see this movie

Miriam Songco I'm going to watch this and hopefully I don't fall asleep. Lol

Faking good movie üòéüòéüòéüòé
This movie was amazing!
Dinora Lopez I want to watch it üòÇ
Loved it. Pain, suffering, perseverance, judgement, drive, will, love, compassion, vengeance, justice...I could go on and on.. The acting was exceptional, and the the detailed actions were captivating.
I mean Leo deserves the Oscar and a part of me hopes he gets it and another part of me doesn't want him to for the sole fact that it will make  him a legend
Awesome movie
Want to see!!!
I liked it alot
I just kept seeing Dicaprio in that Wallstreet movie and how he nailed this part .....He had to actually eat raw fish and buffalo liver after all js lol
Billy Spencer

I wanna see this
Saw it last week....awesome
I want to go see this
Must see
Beautifully filmed movie, great scenery, DiCaprio deserves the Oscar. My only complaint was that it was too long and I don't mind long movies if they further the story in a compelling way. With that said, I highly recommend seeing it.
I want to see this movie!
Slow and boring
The Revenant will bring the top three Oscars, & as far as I am concerned no other movie can come close.
The movie Whiplash comes to mind. Specifically J.K. Simmons character Fletcher. That's Alejandro and what he created was this Masterpiece. Pushing the crew and the actors to their breaking point. Those who endured the pain will live on Forever. As Leonardo DiCaprio puts it. SIGN ME UP!!!! But first let me thank those who came before me for digging the well.
i wanna see this
Excellent movie!!!!
Was great, already got it
I am waiting to see this one
Dame good film.
Great movie.
Based on Truth and turned into a very very good fictional tale
Angel Hernandez I want to see this
Tom hardy was the best in this movie
Oh for gods sake JUST LET HIM HAVE ONE ALREADY
Inspired by true events,instead of Hollywoods version
Orange looks good
Coulda been better.
Can't wait to see it
Edgar Martinez I want to watch this movies
The best movie I have seen in years.  I don't think I could handle the bear scene at the imax
Watching it for a second time tonight!!
So good!!!
I so want to see this!!
Julian Hollinger, did you get to see it?
SO NEED TO SEE THIS !
Best movie I have seen in  long time.
I am curious, I actually want to see this..
Be prepared to be cold.  I  froze for the remainder of the day.
Audrianna Ramos we watching g this TONIGHT
in IMAX? this movie is NOT playing in IMAX anywhere....
Good movie!  üëçwatched it last week
Love the part when he sheltered himself inside that horse...best movie !!!
Awesome movie !!! Wish I could have done some stunts on that movie !!!
üëçüëçin my book.  Di Caprio deserves the Academy Awardüëçüëç
Rich Blumenfeld dang looks good maybe we should go see it???

Creed was way better.
Great movie and even better book!
Can't wait to see it.
Lenisha Poirier this is the movie I was telling you about!
Saw it on Wednesday and I was on the edge of my seat!
Great movie!!! Leonardo definitely deserves an Oscar!!!
Aaron Wigstone Morton i want to see this.
It is a gorgeous movie. The scenery and the way it was shot. Oscar worthy cinematography for sure. The cast was great. Wasn't that impressed with Leo though. Spent a lot of time just laying there while everyone else was acting.
Great movie
What the heck is a Revenant???
One of the best movies I've ever seen!!
I am looking forward to seeing it,,,,, BUT I also as a Horse person want to know the Cliff scene,, and what the hell happened
Hey Karson Ross we should go watch this sometime
Can't wait to see
looks so good, my daughter & her boyfriend went & seen it & said it was great!!
Wading/swimming in icy cold water then sleeping on the frozen ground in wet clothes, totally unbelievable. Can you say Hypothermia!!!!   And the bear attack scene when it lands on him, laughable!
Liked it except the ending which was horribly cliche and unsatisfying.
This movie is a cinematic personification of how Leo feels inside about not winning an Oscar lol
Loved this movie.  Extremely well done!
Yamilette - this movie looks dope babe.
So good!
One of the best movies that I've seen in my life...
great movie
Juan Carlos Madrigal Date night!! Tonight!!!
Masterpiece? I think not. The cinematography was beautiful. BUT, beyond that? Great acting? It should be great acting, it's DiCaprio And Hardy.
Storyline was so/so. Predictable. 
At least it was better than Birdman.
A great movie.
I'm seeing this on Monday. So stoked.
Amazing movie congratulations guy'süëè
Darrian Felsen Amy Erickson Felsen Arlen Felsen you guys got to see this movie it's absolutely incredible in every way possible.
Seeing it tonight...should be awesome.
LOVE that movie!
Saw this with my Dad last Saturday and WOW!!! If Leo doesn't win an Oscar for this one. I don't know what will. Blood Diamond or Departed should of gotten him the Oscar IMO. Anyways, just a fantastic movie and gotta tip my hat off to Tom Hardy as well.
Jade Jade Guevara lets go!!
What a beautiful cold film, Leonardo is the best actor of the world ‚ù§
Leo will finally get his oscar!! üèÜ
Deserve every single penny
Great movie.
Absolutely deserves best picture and Leo's first Oscar
I would LOVE to see this on IMAX! No theaters anywhere near here!
Gabriel Torres Grajales Ay mi madre >
Not yet released in India
DiCaprio is the best‚ú®
best actor >> and best movie :*
Great movie!
One of the best film,which I've ever seen.
loved it!
If Leonardo diCaprio did not get an Oscar, I will be really pissedoff
Leonardo DiCaprio has always been Oscar worthy, if not for #TheRevenant, something is wrong with Hollywood - A definite #MustSee #Wow, my son & I are still blown away ~ Shoutout to Forrest Goodluck, who plays Hawk, his son, good job! :D
I absolutely love all of Inarritu's films but this one was lacking a lot I thought.  I might be crazy I'm going to go see it again that is what faith I have in A. Inarritu but I thought there was a lot of typical hollywood cheese in this movie that is not in his others.
Just saw it and my husband and I were totally amazed and in awe. SPectacular in every way !!!!!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Congratulation Leonardo DiCaprio and everybody that worked for this biggest success.  The Revenant Movie is awesome! Everyone is brilliant. A perfect performence in every way of scene.
Ce film est ABSOLUMENT √† voir ! Je n'ai jamais rien vu de tel ! Pas de mots pour d√©crire cet ovni cin√©matographique .... Exceptionnel. Exceptionnel.....
Marium Khan
Ayesha Khan
Amazing!! you can feel that "driven filled hate" it was an intense film to say the least. #Leo #outdid #himself
Hardy was awesome and immersive as usual, but my man Leo, idk. Alot of reactionary stuff, not enough development in his character for me.
Patrick San Pascual
Gusto ko panoorin to Alyssa Joyce Dolorota watch ntn pgblik m
Leo is in Europe right now promoting this film, he dosen't have to,,,all you good people are doing it for him,,good luck Leo at the oscars it's yours.
Absolutely brilliant
Arbresha Ademi dont forget to watch it...! üëå
Great camera work,beautiful scenery,watching the story unfold but to be honest nop got bored watching it The Bear scene he should of been dead although I watched til the end wouldnt put anyone off  it and yet I wouldnt be boasting about it ,,It's just one of those films, lacking something!
love the revenant movie
Mind blowing acting of Dicaprio!
Congratulations to Alejandro and Leo for the Academy Nominations..!!
Leonardo DiCaprio must  win the oscar this time. enough is enough !!!
Give that man an Oscar!
Just. Beautiful. Oscar for Leo!!!!
Bravo Hardy!
Jared Bennett Alex B Dill
I cant wait to see this movie!!
God this director is incredible, such a rare and unique vision
I wish Domnhall was nominated too
WO_OW simply AMAZING!!!!!!
Hi Leo congrats fo The Revenant  Movie U got This.so great.!!!!!!
I would love to watch the whole movie with this commentary
This was a fantastic movie, I would watch it over and over...
All the LONG shots are the mark of a confident and accomplished director. This movie is THE masterpiece of my movie experiences. I shut my eyes a couple times...I need to see it again with eyes wide open! Thank YOU!
12 nominations for THE REVENANT...
Really,it was one of my best perfect movies..Congratulations Di Cabrio and all the members of that movie :]
My always actor..especially in the wolf of wall street
Freaking Awesome movie!!!
Carson Hughes check this out!!!
Was Di Caprio wearing a wet suit for these river scenes? Cos that's mighty cold water right der.
Can't wait till this one comes out on Blue Ray!
An absolutely stunning movie from the very outset.  I am certainly compelled to go and witness it again.  While it took detours from the book, the direction it took for the big screen in ways that might not have translated as well had Inarritu not done so.  Again, an astounding movie.  A true masterpiece and one worthy of the praise being heaped upon it.
Masterpiece through and through! Hope it wins all 12 gold statues!
just saw this. movie was fucc'n awesome! That bear scene tho! Wow!
What happened to his mouth , on that movie . Have you noticed he's having trouble forming words ?
Awesome movie!
great movie
This is a fantastic movie, the actors, the scenery, everything was so believable, I'm going to see it again!!
Amazing director
Nadia i'm becoming a little bit desperate now! üò´‚ù§Ô∏è
the best the best !!!!!!!
You are amazing actor Leonardo, I'm really enjoyed as usual in your movie you should win an Oscar this time
:-)  Leo for the WIN! :-)
Has anyone here, read the book? We loved the film. It made me want to be part of the special effects makeup team.
he  and DiCaprio are really MONSTER OF ACTING
I liked Men in the wilderness 1971 except there were no attacking Injuns at the beginning.
a great movie and loved the action shots.  However i do believe Hohlloywood took some liberties
l√©o deserve an oscar (y) awsome movie ‚ô•
Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy were amazing. They both must win Oscar
Watched it twice...... So far!!!! Already want to watch it again!!
Nominated! Yes!
Bravo Alejandro Gonzales I√±arritu! üëèüèºüëèüèº amazing!
Amazing film BRAVO MAESTRO!!!
Amazing movie!! üëçüëç
Judi the bear
R√©mon hier moeten we echt heen man
As I commented elsewhere on FB, LD no doubt won a Golden Globe to simply get the directors to wrap up the story and stop filming this incredibly long, long, dry, cold, film. Absolutely Leonardo DiCaprio deserved an award for his acting. His scenes were long and brutal under very challenging winter conditions. Other than his acting skills, the movie is not all that. He carried the film. Still just too drawn out. It would have been a favor to moviegoers to chop off at least 30 minutes of the film. If I had a do over, I'd wait to see it on Netflix.
Revenant starring DiCaprio was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  Scenery where it was filed was beautiful.  The film would not be possible and the story would not be possible without the Native Indians in it and Oscars should be shared with the Native actors.  Let's not be selfish as was depicted by "fritzgerald" the greedy evil guy played by Hardy.
Steven Matthew Sterrett I want to watch the whole film with I√±√°rritu's commentary
I just watch it! 20 stars out of 10. Leonardo needs to win this OSCAR!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oscar Gold Sweep! (y)
This is new way of shooting and directing, they way to see.
Give this guy the Oscar before he kills himself for christ sake.
If Leo doesn't win the Oscar for The Revenant something is definitely wrong with the academy. He is one of the best actors of our time. Though visually beautiful, this movie is not for the faint of heart. prepare yourself for intense scenes, some of which may be difficult to watch. But it is deserving of all the accolades it is receivimg.
Really good movie!
Shannon Howell and I are going this Sunday! She's stoked!
Great movie
Leonardo DiCaprio is way long overdue for his Oscar. If this Film does not give him his Oscar then it just proves that the Oscar committee  favors certain Actors. 
Leonardo DiCaprio deserves his Oscar and if he does not win. He will never win and that sucks. 
Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy were both terrific in this Film. 
Leo was so good I thought I was watching real footage of the Real Hugh Glass. 
That BEAR Attack scene was so real you can't get anymore real then that.
David para mi cumple üòå
Very raw & intense film. Beautiful cinematography & creative film shots. Great acting by Leonardo DiCaprio & Tom Hardy.
would love to see DiCaprio winning the oscar this time
Thomas Clarke "thats so cool"
I really hope Leo wins, very well deserving. I cannot imagine what they had to go through filming in Southern Argentina. I have spent some time there and its quite adventurous but also scary
Shyam Narayan. This. :)
great movie
amazing movie
This movie really draws you in and the score was amazing. Best movie that I have seen in over 10 years.
Does anyone know what the asteroid was about?
Die gaan we zien.
Give Tom hardy a Oscar already
Moises this type of planning is so freakin crazy.
some scenes are too long and it is sad that scenario degraded indian attack to fur ownership (twice) shame ...
film ini dirasi lebih dari 2 jam
Proud of the Director!  N as usual a magnificent role played by my all time favorite Leo Di Caprio üòç
Awesome film!  I think it's a modern day version of 'Jeremiah Johnson' except less Hollywoodish.
absolutely beauty. Give the man oscar at last.
#giveoscartoleo you're amazing Leonardo, we support you! giveoscartoleo.com
A movie you never miss.Great wk
Saw the movie a few weeks back and although I've never been a big fan of DiCaprio I thought his performance was worthy of an Oscar. Speaking dialogue in a manner convincing enough to make people appreciate the actor's ability is tough enough (especially if you have little talent - and I am not implying he doesn't) but when you have to convince a sceptical public that your throat has almost been torn out, every nuance of your acting ability is on naked display. He does this with incredible aplomb - I really believed he was Hugh Glass.
Laurie Rouas nouveau film avec ton beau L√©o üòò
Very moving !
You got to see this movie Neil , he deserves to win an oscar . It's about time !
I think the bear deserve the #Oscar üòÖ
Babe I wanna watch this üëÄ Britnie Ross
People keep complaining about the length of the movie. The story was suppose to be drawn out and long because it emphasizes how far Glass was willing to go to avenge his son. If they skipped half of his journey and went straight To his arrival at the fort, no one would understand fully how long his journey was. It was a perfect length and an amazing film
Hope 28th Feb coming for u
Is good movie
A-W-E-S-O-M-E...GREAT MOVIE WITH GREAT ACTOR.
One of the BEST movies ever made in my opinion!!!
Speechless acting og leonardo Leonardo DiCaprio
Loved this movie!!! I hope it wins the oscar !!!
Shaikh Tauheed Pasha

Eileen Dillon let's watch it!
I would love to see both Dicaprio and Hardy get best actor and best supporting actor!
If Leo doesn't win we riot!!!
Best actor by a country mile. I doubt it will win the best picture; fingers crossed for Hardy.
Abigail Kavaa we have to watch it,,,,india did no release this movie yet... lol
Leo better FINALLY win his Oscar. This is ridiculous considering his record of outstanding work. "The Revenant" is no exception and is another perfect example of his brilliance as an actor.
Told you guys
And the Oscar goes to ... Leo üòä !
Here we go ‚ù§
Best Actor !!!
It was the the best in years!! So very happy for all! I was on edge the entire time as if I was there, I LOVE movies that invite me in for the ride!
Mihai, vine Oscarul si pentru Leo :)))
It's going to clean house! Phenomenal movie.
En esperant qu il l ai !
I'm happy for Tom Hardy.  He was excellent in it.
I wanna see it again
All the best !!!!! Best movie in 2015
Thankfully they included Tom but robbed your composers this time
At this point leo could care less if he wins an oscar. This guy is damn legend
DxOx, ok I need to get on this lol
It's time for Leo!!
Use the same picture and replace nominations with "wins"
WHAT ABOUT  "OSKAR"???????
they forgot best supporting actor... the bear. he made it look real lol
BEST movie <3
This will sweep the awards for sure. Solid movie in every sense of the word.
LEO BETTER WIN.
Best film since unbroken came out
i love leo and hardy
Oh man .. 12 oscars nominations .. 

Abdullah Hamid Daniyal Qazi Haad Khan Hamza Parvez Basit Shah

Steven Cameron ugh I can't wait!!! üòòüëèüèª
Hands down new favorite movie.
This is it leo... congratulations in advance  to the whole cast of The Revenant! kudos!
The part where he rides over the cliff...
Sean McGee Yes! You won't understand how good this is until you watch it.
Giorgi Vardanidze ai naxe es?
i think it will win at least seven awards this year
let's make this universal  #leoscar
Leonardo DiCaprio should have won an Oscar for his work on [insert any DiCaprio film here].
Seriously the best cinematography!!! Loved it!!
BEST MOVIE 2016 ;)
We really enjoyed that one but loved The Hateful Eight more.
Very Nice
It's amazing
I can't stop talking about this movie...usually after a few days...I've forgotten most of any movie that I've seen. Not this one...LD is a brilliant actor! The story was well down...the cinematography the best that I've seen in my movie watching history. Everything about this movie is great!
the best in everything !
First 4rom. are for Revenant.
It was better than sat wars. And I'm a huge Star Wars fan.
And the Oscar goes to Leonardo DiCaprio.
Winner!  I predicted this outcome.  It's  Leonard  Dicaprio's  year.
Saw it last night. Will pay to see it again. The use of natural light was  PHENOMENAL!
Yes yes yessss!!! <3
I watch the movie and such a great job 
Best of luck
best bear
Well deserved.
As well it should have!
One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The actors, the cinematography, the feel, the story... All fantastic. LEO has deserved an Oscar for many of his roles in other films, but has never deserved it more than for this one. And Tom Hardy was pheonmenal as well.
Top 5 best movies I ever seen. Dicaprio, hardy, inarritu & chive killed
And The Oscar Goes To Leonardo DiCaprio üèÜüòçüòÅüòâ
No doubt Tom Hardy is deserving but we'll see if he actually wins! He is a phenomenal actor! From Inception to Warrior to Lawless, The Drop, Batman, Mad Max and on and on...
Congrats to the cast of this great mpvie.i hope they win,but i prefer to wait to celebrate on oscar night.I remember what happened to the movie the color purple.
Leo's Masterpiece ,he'll finally get the Oscar ‚ù§
Great movie !üëèüëèüëè
Nice to see tom hardy get some love. I thought he was being snubbed too much. He played the role of fitzgerald very good.
Indeed. I loved the movie so much after a very long time
An Oscar for Leo!!! Awesome movie!!
==> best movie
Cinematography, hands down. This movie is beautiful!
The Oscar will be win by the BEAR(BEST ACTOR)
best ive ever seen
It's really that good!  Thanks again, Nora Pechka!
He Deserved It!! This Was One Of The Most Amazingly Stunning And Tragically Beautiful Movies!!
El Rey   Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu ,The Revenant is Big Movie :)
Quero esse samba no Brasil logoooooo
So happy for him. Totally deserves it. His talent is out of this world!!! Loved the move just brilliant! Love his work. Congrats Alejandro G I√±√°rritu , I'm immensely proud of you!!! Have your hands ready for many Oscars! Same wishes and positive vibes for Leo DiCaprio, your work was astonishing as well, I really wish you win an Oscar, you should have won one many years ago! üíòüëçüèº‚ù§Ô∏èüëèüèºüá≤üáΩüìΩ
I look forward to see this great movie. However, I will have to wait until  the movie is on my computer, as I am an elderly person, I no longer drive, so theatres are out for me.
YEA SON!!!!!!
Nicole Why couldn't our AMC get it? :'(
not in Brazil though
If their is a god then he made this director and actor.
Here we go again maestro. I√±arritu comes loaded for the oscar one more time.
Have to see this!
Brilliant movie all around!
First 'Birdman' and now this. Way to go. :)
2 hour drive to see The Revenant in Imax?  I think yes!
It should have been on IMAX in the first place
Congrats!!!! Its a beautiful movie!!!
This was the best movie of the year, no problem at all.
Great acting and story line if only Hollywood could use some other words besides my God's name to emphasize a dramatic event. Enough already!!

Oscar is urs! Leo dang! U had me on a roller coaster of emotionsüò¢üòÜüëäüèΩüôèüèΩüòî ur so amazing.
A tan s√≥lo ! 2 Semanas ! De que se Estrene esta GRANDIOSA y ESTREMECEDORA Cinta en MEXICO.
What an amazing movie. Bravo!!
Just saw itüëèüëè loved it
This is a good film but it is not for everyone, even all adults. Leonardo is outstanding, as are the costumes, acting sets, plot and setttings. It is realistically, appropriately exceptionally gory and that will put some off. If you enjoy a good film go see it but you may not want to go on a full tummy.
Jake Nasz might have run back that free popcorn move this Tuesday and see this one
This movie was so good, I'm going to watch it again!
So happy for all involved in this epic film. I have to say Leo has done phenomenal work and this film will put him in the Academy elite, Finally!!!‚ù§Ô∏èüíïüçæ‚ú®üåü
12 nominations for the Oscars! Nice! Very deserving!
12 Oscar Nominations ... Movie of the year ....
Hey you guys know you have 12 Oscar noms right? I'm waiting for you to post it so I can share it lol.....
Have to see
Muero porque llegue a M√©xico la pel√≠cula!!
This guy is simply genius
Its Fantastic Move Owowo
Congrats Alejandro! This is one excellent film, I loved each and every scene. Best film so far!
Great intense movie.Leave you hanging onto your seat.A movie that makes you want to jump on on the action.Also very raw movie,great effects.Some of the I scenes was emotional..But greatest movie so far..
Where's are the IMAX locations?
That is one awesome movie!!! Good job Alejandro g inarritu. Good job
La mejor pelicula que he visto. Felicidades Alejandro I√±arrit√π por tu gran trabajo. Eres un orgullo grande :)
This movie was the best movie i have ever seen! It easily tops my list above Pulp Fiction and the performance by Leo is equal to that of Kevin Costner in Dances with Wolves. The performance of Tom Hardy was exhilarating and excelled the movie over the top as it pushed DiCaprio to unleash his inner essence, one in which we have not seen since Shutter Island. If he is not awarded an Oscar the judges should be pelted with stones for committing such a sin!
Excellent director.He deserves an other Oscar.
You are Great Film Maker Sir Salutes you...
Way to go AlejandroG. Inarritu!!!! HE deserves it!!
Long movie but had me captured the whole time.
Very proud of this man!!! Mexican Talent!!! Keep killing it Alejandro
some scenes are too long and it is sad that scenario degraded indian attack to fur ownership (twice) shame ...
Leo u r awesome .... keep great as always...
Excellent director.
Oh my, I'd love to see this in IMAX.
Felicidades! Alejandro para ti y todo el elenco de esta pelicila
Ryan Bleau - he's a "hobbyist" too üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Great job ! Thank youu
Estamos orgullosos de ustedes I√±arritu y Por supuesto del Chivo y su magia en la fotograf√≠a, de  nuestros directores, actores, actrices, guionistas, etc. Gracias por ense√±ar a nuestros j√≥venes que se vale so√±ar en grande! Y se debe luchar por ese sue√±o! Viva M√©xico cabrones!!
We are waiting for this movie for months in turkey..finally watched 2 days ago..great acting and great scenes..( bear attack and flying with horseüòÅ)All we say really amazing!
