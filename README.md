# TERApprentissage

FEATURES:

- Neural network to predict if a sentence is positive or negative ( 75 % accuracy ) 
- SVM to predict if a sentence is positive or negative ( 83 % accuracy ) 
- Twitter bot to post messages and images
- A class to load neural network models and use them to predict sentences classes
- A class to detect the language of a text
- A class to "tag" sentences (bind each words with its grammatical tag)
- A module to fetch messages and comments from Facebook pages. It's also possible to find all pages using keywords and settings such as number of likes...
