aS"As much as I enjoyed this film, there were some serious flaws in editing. Most filming was in Canada but we understand they had to  go to the mountains in Argentina to finish the winter scenes. So one minute they're in the flat lands of North Dakota and the next minute they're on a mountaintop in the Andes. One minute it's a summer scene on a river - and the next minute they're on a snowy mountaintop again. It made no sense. The director should have caught these careless mistakes."

When I looked in the Best Buy computer last month I found no soundtrack for Inarritu's 2015-2016 The Revenant but only a soundtrack for the 2009 movie. Don't order the wrong soundtrack. I sent email to WDNA-FM praising the use of percussion in Inarritu's The Revenant. Was Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu a soundtrack man before he became a movie director?"

I cried when the bear attacked Hugh Glass, when he laid on the child's chest deat, and when he slept inside the horse to survive the cold weather. My heart almost came out the mouth throughout the film. Hugh was a great warrior. A much pain in search of survival. Splendid! And you Leo, was brilliant performance along with everyone. Congratulations again, over and over Leonardo DiCaprio, Alejandro Gonz\xc3\xa1les I\xc3\xb1\xc3\xa1rritu and everyone else. You deserve all kinds of awards for showing us scenes in a past reality of so much suffering, and you have suffered a little for it as real.

aS'"While exploring the uncharted wilderness in 1823, legendary frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) sustains injuries from a brutal bear attack. When his hunting team leaves him for dead, Glass must utilize his survival skills to find a way back home to his beloved family. Grief-stricken and fueled by vengeance, Glass treks through the wintry terrain to track down John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), the former confidant who betrayed and abandoned him." - - Reading this description I see that they are inventing this. Hugh did not have any family from all accounts of his life; he was originally seeking vengeance but after meeting up with John Fitzgerald he did not; actually what he wanted most of all was his rifle which he got back. Oh and the other person that was with him and abandoned him was Jim Bridger. Oh Hugh was part of a hunting detail when he got attacked. I wonder if they will show how he died. Too bad they did not use this book as the whole story (The Saga of Hugh Glass -- Pirate, Pawnee and Mountain Man by John Myers Myers) Still going to see the movie.'

aS'After reading two books on Hugh Glass and knowing the story way ahead of time, went to the movie today: A Great Epic Wilderness Adventure, easily of the Caliber of "The Big Sky", "Jeremiah Johnson", "A Man called Horse", "Dances with Wolves", "The Mountain Men," and of course "Man in the Wilderness" that is also about Hugh Glass. Couple of observations: Glass survived because his initial ordeal took place in summer not winter. He survived on bugs, rodents and roots. In his torn-up condition, he would have quickly frozen to death in winter. He also historically "danced with wolves" by himself to get the dead buffalo, thus getting all tore up again, so it should have been that way in the movie. I really wanted to see him fight them off the way Charlton Heston did in "The Mountain Men" that borrowed from this tale, so I was a bit disappointed. There were other things, but all in all, it pretty much proved that people today may think they are tough - but NOBODY is "Hugh Glass Tough!!" :D Sadly, I didn\'t catch any of the dialogue, because I\'m too deaf to make out any of the words. Still a 100% great flick!  Great effort on everyone\'s part!!\nDiCaprio?  He\'s now up there with the Studs of Old Time Hollywood - but can he stay there?  I sure hope so!!  Get him, Kurt Russell, and Val Kilmer together to Defend the Alamo - and this time do it all RIGHT!'

aS'May have been "Inspired by true events" but not all the events in the movie were 100% true. Fitzgerald was only 23 in 1823 when the movie was set (not in his early 40\'s) and actually died in 1854; Glass did not have a son; the events took place in Central South Dakota and no snow covered mountains in SD; events took place in May to Aug so certainly no snow in August. I could go on but won\'t. If you disregard the actual facts, it is a great Hollywood adaptation of a man\'s journey back from being left for dead. Cinematography is outstanding - felt as if you were right there. Only thing missing was smells and the severe coldness and wetness. [Too bad theaters cannot actually immerse the audience into those conditions.]'

You are the people that don't know the first thing about what a Masterpiece is.\nThis Movie is without a dought a True Cinema Masterpiece.\nLeonardo DiCaprio is a truly wonderful gifted Actor. \nTom Hardy played a really good Villain. To pull off a role where you hated him for leaving Hugh Glass half dead and left for dead in a shallow grave.\nWow that was amazing to play such a role. \nAnd another thing you Movie haters are forgetting Leonardo DiCaprio learned to speak another language for this Movie.\nThis Film will go down in history as one of the BEST Movies made of our times.\nThank you Leo and Tom for bring this movie to the Big Screen.\nIn the last couple of years there has been some good movies.\nBut in all honestly not worth going to see at the theaters.\nThe Revenant was and is why we go to the Theaters."

It was completely over exaggerated.  There was a lot of Hollywood embellishment which is often done but in this case detracted from the story instead of add to it the way Titanic did with the made up love story.  By this I mean the whole relationship with the son and the death of the son as well as a bunch of other over exaggerated stuff  I also didn't feel this was dicaprio's best performance.  It felt a little forced for some reason and I think he's a great actor but don't feel it was at the level of the Aviator or Blood Diamond."

How a man goes to work outside his home and do not return for months or not return at all because he can get killed in so many ways. His office is the forest and what it offered. There were no high rise offices back then, no cars, no roads. Watching this movie made me realized how lucky I am to live in 2016.

And no he didn't die of blood poisoning which in real life he would have a day or two after the mauling...falling off a cliff into a 40 meter high tree then onto the snowy ground --- I thought he's definitely dead- but no just gets up and on with it....

I have even now added it to the list of the top 10 movies of all time. Nothing is perfect, my only criticism, it could have cut one of the scenes near the end, as the movie maybe went on 5 minutes too long. Finally unless there is an extrordinary performance in another film, I think Di Cappario is shoe-in for the Academy Award his performance was on par with Forest Whitaker in Last King of Scotland and Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man i.e. just hand him the statue.'

aS"As I commented elsewhere on FB, LD no doubt won a Golden Globe to simply get the directors to wrap up the story and stop filming this incredibly long, long, dry, cold, film. Absolutely Leonardo DiCaprio deserved an award for his acting. His scenes were long and brutal under very challenging winter conditions. Other than his acting skills, the movie is not all that. He carried the film. Still just too drawn out. It would have been a favor to moviegoers to chop off at least 30 minutes of the film. If I had a do over, I'd wait to see it on Netflix."
p3060
aS'Revenant starring DiCaprio was one of the best movies I\'ve seen in a long time.  Scenery where it was filed was beautiful.  The film would not be possible and the story would not be possible without the Native Indians in it and Oscars should be shared with the Native actors.  Let\'s not be selfish as was depicted by "fritzgerald" the greedy evil guy played by Hardy.'

Speaking dialogue in a manner convincing enough to make people appreciate the actor's ability is tough enough (especially if you have little talent - and I am not implying he doesn't) but when you have to convince a sceptical public that your throat has almost been torn out, every nuance of your acting ability is on naked display. He does this with incredible aplomb - I really believed he was Hugh Glass."

aS'This movie was the best movie i have ever seen! It easily tops my list above Pulp Fiction and the performance by Leo is equal to that of Kevin Costner in Dances with Wolves. The performance of Tom Hardy was exhilarating and excelled the movie over the top as it pushed DiCaprio to unleash his inner essence, one in which we have not seen since Shutter Island. If he is not awarded an Oscar the judges should be pelted with stones for committing such a sin!'
